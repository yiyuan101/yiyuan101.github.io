**Section II  Reading Comprehension**

**Part A**

　　Directions:

　　Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET. (40 points)

　**Text 1**

France, which prides itself as the global innovator of fashion, has decided its fashion industry has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty for women. Its lawmakers gave preliminary approval last week to a law that would make it a crime to employ ultra-thin models on runaways. The parliament also agreed to ban websites that “incite excessive thinness” by promoting extreme dieting. 

Such measures have a couple of uplifting motives. They suggest beauty should not be defined by looks that end up impinging on health. That’s a start. And the ban on ultra-thin models seems to go beyond protecting models from starving themselves to death-as some have done. It tells the fashion industry that it must take responsibility for the signal it sends women, especially teenage girls, about the social tape-measure they must use to determine their individual worth.

The bans, if fully enforced,would suggest to women (and many men) that they should not let others be arbiters of their beauty. And perhaps faintly,they hint that people should look to intangible qualities like character and intellect rather than dieting their way to size zero or wasp-waist physiques. 

The French measures, however, rely too much on severe punishment to change a culture that still regards beauty as skin-deep-and bone-showing. Under the law, using a fashion model that does not meet a government-defined index of body mass could result in a $85,000 fine and six months in prison.

The fashion industry knows it has an inherent problem in focusing on material adornment and idealized body types. In Denmark, the United States, and a few other countries, it is trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion images that rely more on peer pressure for enforcement.

In contrast to France’s actions, Denmark’s fashion industry agreed last month on rules and sanctions regarding the age, health, and other characteristics of models. The newly revised Danish Fashion Ethical Charter clearly states: “We are aware of and take responsibility for the impact the fashion industry has on body ideals, especially on young people.” The charter’s main tool of enforcement is to deny access for designers and modeling agencies to Copenhagen Fashion Week (CFW), which is run by the Danish Fashion Institute. But in general it relies on a name-and-shame method of compliance. 

Relying on ethical persuasion rather than law to address the misuse of body ideals may be the best step. Even better would be to help elevate notions of beauty beyond the material standards of a particular industry. 

\21. According to the first paragraph, what would happen in France?

 [A]New runways would be constructed.

 [B]Physical beauty would be redefined. 

[C]Websites about dieting would thrive.

 [D]The fashion industry would decline. 

\22. The phrase “impinging on” (Line2, Para.2) is closest in meaning to     .

[A]heightening the value of. 

[B]indicating the state of. 

[C]losing faith in. 

[D]doing harm to.

\23. Which of the following is true of the fashion industry?

[A]New standards are being set in Denmark. 

[B]The French measures have already failed. 

[C]Models are no longer under peer pressure. 

[D]Its inherent problems are getting worse.  

\24. A designer is most likely to be rejected by CFW for      .

[A]pursuing perfect physical conditions. 

[B]caring too much about models’ character. 

[C]showing little concern for health factors. 

[D]setting a high age threshold for models.  

\25. Which of the following may be the best title of the text? 

[A]A Challenge to the Fashion Industry’s Body Ideals 

[B]A Dilemma for the Starving Models in France 

[C]Just Another Round of Struggle for Beauty 

[D]The Great Threats to the Fashion Industry

**Text 2**

  For the first time in history more people live in towns than in the country. In Britain this has had a curious result. While polls show Britons rate “the countryside” alongside the royal family, Shakespeare and the National Health Service (NHS) as what makes them proudest of their country, this has limited political support. 

  A century ago Octavia Hill launched the National Trust not to rescue stylish houses but to save “the beauty of natural places for everyone forever.” It was specifically to provide city dwellers with spaces for leisure where they could experience “a refreshing air.” Hill’s pressures later led to the creation of national parks and green belts. They don’t make countryside any more, and every year concrete consumes more of it. It needs constant guardianship. 

At the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse this sentiment. The Conservatives’ planning reform explicitly gives rural development priority over conservation, even authorizing“off-plan” building where local people might object. The concept of sustainable development has been defined as profitable. Labour likewise wants to discontinue local planning where councils oppose development. The Liberal Democrats are silent. Only Ukip, sensing its chance, has sided with those pleading for a more considered approach to using green land. Its Campaign to Protect Rural England struck terror into many local Conservative parties. 

The sensible place to build new houses, factories and offices is where people are, in cities and towns where infrastructure is in place. The London agents StirlingAckroyd recently identified enough sites for half a million houses in the London area alone, with no intrusion on green belt. What is true of London is even truer of the provinces. 

  The idea that “housing crisis” equals “concreted meadows” is pure lobby talk. The issue is not the need for more houses but, as always, where to put them. Under lobby pressure, George Osborne favours rural new-build against urban renovation and renewal. He favours out-of-town shopping sites against high streets. This is not a free market but a biased one. Rural towns and villages have grown and will always grow. They do so best where building sticks to their edges and respects their character. We do not ruin urban conservation areas. Why ruin rural ones? 

  Development should be planned, not let rip. After the Netherlands, Britain is Europe’s most crowded country. Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living. There is no doubt of the alternative—the corrupted landscapes of southern Portugal, Spain or Ireland. Avoiding this rather than promoting it should unite the left and right of the political spectrum. 

\26. Britain’s public sentiment about the countryside     .

[A]didn’tstart till the Shakespearean age. 

[B]has brought much benefit to the NHS. 

[C]is fully backed by the royal family. 

[D]is not well reflected in politics.  

\27. According to Paragraph 2, the achievements of the National Trust are now being____ .

[A]gradually destroyed. 

[B]effectively reinforced. 

[C]largely overshadowed. 

[D]properly protected.

\28. Which of the following can be inferred from Paragraph 3? 

[A]Labour is under attack for opposing development.

[B]The Conservatives may abandon “off-plan” building. 

[C]The Liberal Democrats are losing political influence.

[D]Ukip may gain from its support for rural conservation.  

\29. The author holds that George Osborne’s preference____ .

[A]highlights his firm stand against lobby pressure. 

[B]shows his disregard for the character of rural areas. 

[C]stresses the necessity of easing the housing crisis. 

[D]reveals a strong prejudice against urban areas.  

\30. In the last paragraph, the author shows his appreciation of____ .

[A]the size of population in Britain. 

[B]the political life in today’s Britain. 

[C]the enviable urban lifestyle in Britain. 

[D]the town-and-country planning in Britain.

**Text 3**

“There is one and only one social responsibility of business,” wrote Milton Friedman,a Nobel prize-winning economist “That is, to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.” But even if you accept Fiedman’s premise and regard corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies as a waste of shareholders money,things may not be absolutely clear-cut.New research suggests that CSR may create monetary value for companies –at least when they are prosecuted for corruption. 

The largest firms is America and Britain together spend more than $15 billion a year on CSR , according to an estimate by EPG,a consulting firm ,This could add value to their businesses in three ways.First, consumers may take CSR spending as a “signal” that a company’s products are of high quality.Second, customers may be willing to buy a company’s products as an indirect way to donate to the good causes is helps. And third, through a more diffuse “halo effect,” whereby its good deeds earn it greater consideration from consumers and others. 

Previous studies on CSR have had trouble differentiating these effects because consumers can be affected by all three. A recent study attempts to separate them by looking at bribery prosecutions under America’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It argues that since prosecutors do not consume a company's products as part of their investigations, they could be influenced only by the halo effect. 

The study found that, among prosecuted firms, those with the most comprehensiveCSR programmes tendedto getmore lenient penalties. Their analysis ruled out the possibility that it was firms' political influence, rather than their CSR stand,that accounted for the leniency: Companies that contributed more to political campaigns did not receive lower fines.

In all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors should only evaluate a case based on its merits, they do seen to influenced by a company’s record in CSR. "We estimate that either eliminating a substantial labour-rights concern, such as child labour, or increasing corporate giving by about 20% results in fines that generally are 40% lower than the typical punishment for bribing foreign officials," says one researcher. 

Researchers admit that their study does not answer the question of how much businesses ought to spend on CSR. Nor does it reveal how much companies are banking on the halo effect, rather than the other possible benefits, when they decide their do-gooding policies. But at least have demonstrated that whencompanies get into trouble with the law, evidence of good character can win In all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors should only evaluate a case based on its merits, they do seen to influenced by a company’s record in CSR.

**Text 4**

​     There will eventually come a day when The New York Times cases to publish stories on newsprint .Exactly when that day will be is a matter of debate. “Sometime in the future “the paper’s publisher said back in 2010. 

​     Nostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside ,there’s plenty of incentive to ditch print .The infrastructure required to make a physical newspapers -printing presses .delivery truck -isn’t just expensive it’s excessive at a time when online-only competition don’t have the same set financial constraints . Readers are migrating away from print away,And although print ad sales still dwarf their online and mobile counterparts revenue from print is still declining. 

​     Overhead may be high and circulation lowe ,but rushing to eliminate its print editor would be a mistake ,says BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti. 

  Peretti says the Times shouldn't waste time getting of the print business, only if they go about doing it the right away “Figuring out a way to accelerate that transition would make sense for them “he said, “but if you discontinue it, you're going to have your most loyal customers really upset with you." Sometimes that's worth making a change anyway". Peretti gives example of Netflix discontinuing its DVD-mailing service to focus on streaming. "It was seen as a blunder." he said. The move turned out to be foresighted. And if Peretti were in charge at the times? "l wouldn't pick year to end print."he said. “I would raise and make it into more of a legacy product.” 

The most loyal costumer would still gel the product they favor. the idea goes, and they’d feel like they were helping sustain the quality of something they believe in. "So if you're overpaying for print, you could feel like you were helping," peretti said. "Then increase it at rate each year and essentially try to generate additional revenue." In other words, if you're going to print product, make it for the people who are already obsessed with it. Which may be what the Times is doing already. Getting the print edition seven days a week costs nearly $500 a year — more than twice as much as a digital-only subscription.   

"It's a really hard thing to do and it's a tremendous luxury that BuzzFeed doesn't have a legacy business," Peretti remarked. "But we're going to have questions like that where we have things we're doing that don't make sense when the market.Change and the world changes. In those situations, it's better to be more aggressive than less aggressive."

36.The New York Times is considering ending its print edition partly due      .

[A]the high cost of operation. 

[B]the pressure form its investors.

[C]the complaints form its readers

No matter how formal orinformal theworkenvironment,the way you present yourself has an impact.This isespecially truein first impressions.According to researchfrom PrincetonUniversity, people assessyour competence,Trustworthiness, and likeability in just a tenth of a second, solelybased ontheway you look. 

  The different between today’sworkplace and the “dress for success”era is that the range of optionsis so muchbroader. Normshaveevolvedandfragmented.In some settings, red sneakers or dress T—shirts can conveystatus;inother not somuch. Plus, whatever  image we present is magnified by social—media services  like LinkedIn.Chances are, your headshots are seen much more often now than adecade or two ago.Millennials, it seems, face the paradox of being the least formal generation yet the most conscious of style and personal branding.It can beconfusing. 

  So how do we navigate this?How do we know when to invest in anupgrade?And what’s the best way to pull off  one  that enhances our goals？Here are some  tips: 





| 41.  |      |
| ---- | ---- |
|      |      |

 

As an executive coach, I’ve  seen  image   upgrades   be   particularlyhelpfulduring  transitions—when looking  for a new  job ,  stepping  into  a  new  or  morepublic role ,or changing  work  environments. If you’re in a period of change or just feeling stuck and in a rut, now may be a good time. If you’re not sure, ask forhonest feedback  from trusted friends, colleagues and professionals .Look for cues 

about how others perceive you. Maybe there’s no need for an upgrade and that’s OK. 





| 42.  |      |
| ---- | ---- |
|      |      |

 

Get clear on what impact you’re hoping to have. Are you looking to refresh your image or pivot it? For one person, the goal may be to be taken more seriously and enhance their professional image. For another, it may be to be perceived as more approachable, or more modern and stylish. For someone moving from finance to advertising, maybe they want to look ore “SoHo.” (It’s OK to use characterizations like that.) 





| 43.  |      |
| ---- | ---- |
|      |      |

 

Look at your work environment like an anthropologist. What are the norms of your environment? What conveys status? Who are your most important audience? How do the people you respect and look up to prevent themselves? The better you understand the cultural context, the more control you can have over your impact.





| 44.  |      |
| ---- | ---- |
|      |      |

 

Enlist the support of professionals and share with them your goals and context. Hire a personal stylist, or use the free styling service of a store like Crew. Try a hair stylist instead of a barber. Work with a professional photographer instead of your spouse of friend. It’s not as expensive as you might think. 





| 45.  |      |
| ---- | ---- |
|      |      |

 

The point of a style upgrade isn’t to become more vain or to spend more time discussing over what to wear. Instead, use it as an opportunity to reduce decision fatigue. Pick a standard work uniform or a few go-to opinions. Buy all your clothes once with a stylist instead of shopping alone, one article of clothing a time. 

 

**Part C** 

Directions: 

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written neatly on the ANSWER SHEET. (10 pionts) 

Mental health is our birthright. (46) We don’t have to learn how to be mentally healthy; it is built into us in the same way that our bodies know how to heal a cut or mend a broken bone. Mental health can't be learned, only reawakened. It is like the immune system of the body, which under stress or through lack of nutrition or exercise can be weakened, but which never leaves us. When we don't understand the value of mental health and we don't know how to gain access to it, mental health will remain hidden from us. (47) Our mental health doesn’t really go anywhere; like the sun behind a cloud. it can be temporarily hidden from view, but it is fully capable of being restored in an instant. 

Mental health is the seed that contains self-esteem — confidence in ourselves and an ability to trust in our common sense. It allows us to have perspective on our lives — the ability to not take ourselves too seriously, to laugh at ourselves, to see the bigger picture, and to see that things will work out. It's a form of innate or unlearned optimism. (48) Mental health allows us to view others with sympathy if they are having troubles with kindness if they are in pain and with unconditional love no matter who they are. Mental health is the source of creativity for solving  problems, resolving conflict, making our surroundings more beautiful, managing our home life, or coming up with a creative business idea or invention to make our lives easier. It gives us patience for ourselves and toward others as well as patience while driving, catching a fish, working on our car. or raising a child. It allows us to see the beauty that surrounds us each moment in nature, in culture, in the flow of our daily lives. 

(49)Although mental health is the cure-all for living our lives, it is perfectly ordinary as you will see that it has been there to direct you through all your difficult decisions. It has been available even in the most mundane of life situations to show you right from wrong, good from bad, friend from foe. Mental health has commonly been called conscience, instinct, wisdom, common sense, or the inner voice. We think of it simply as a healthy and helpful flow of intelligent thought. (50) As you will come to see, knowing that mental health is always available and knowing to trust it allow us to slow down to the moment and live life happily.

　【考点分析】 上下文语义

7、【答案】 [C]but

　【考点分析】 逻辑关系题

16、【答案】[B]whatever

　 【考点分析】 语法

【真题翻译】在柬埔寨，伴侣的选择对于年轻男性来说是一个复杂的问题。这不仅与他本人以及未来伴侣的父母朋友相关，而且与媒婆也有着千丝万缕的关系。他可以自己选择自己中意的伴侣并让父母安排相关事务，或者几乎不参与，完全让父母选择自己的对象。理论上来说，女方可以拒绝她父母所选择的对象。在选好自己的对象后，每个家庭都能会去调查对方家庭来确保他们的孩子嫁到好人家。

传统的婚礼是一段漫长，多姿多彩的过程。从前会持续三天，但是到了20世纪80年代，一般会持续一天半。佛教徒通常会做简短诵经，并为新人祈福。仪式通常包括剪发，在新郎新娘的胳膊上系上浸满圣水的棉绳，在幸福的、受人尊敬的夫妇中传递蜡烛来祈祷新人的结合。通常情况下，新婚夫妇会到妻子父母家里住一年，直到他们在附近建一栋新房子为止。

离婚是合法的，而且很容易获得批准，但是在实际中这种情况并不常见。离过婚的男女会受到一些人的诟病。夫妇双方在离婚后可保有他或她婚前带来的财产，而且可平分婚后共同取得的财产。离过婚的人或许会再婚，但是性别偏见还是很明显。比如，离过婚的男性再婚前不需要一段等待期而女性则需要等待十个月。

 

**Section II Reading Comprehension** 　 **Part A** 　　**Text 1**

21、【答案】A Physical beauty would be redefined

　  【解析】这是一道细节题，根据France定位到第一段第一句，主干成分为France has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty。此外第二段第二句They suggest beauty should not be define by looks…故而A physical beauty would be redefined为同义替换，即为正确答案。

22、【答案】 D doing harm to

　 【解析】此题为词义题。定位到第二段第二句They suggest beauty should not be defined by looks that end up impinging on health。根据end up可以看出beauty should not be defined by looks 和that end up impinging on health为顺承关系，所以“改变人们对美不仅仅是外表的定义”可以结束对健康的危害。故而可以推知doing harm to是正确答案。

23、【答案】B. New Standards are being set in Denmark

　　【解析】此题是正误判断题。根据第五段第二句话 In Denmark，…it is trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion…可知B选项 New standards are being set in Denmark是其同义替换。

24、【答案】C showing little concern for health factors

　 【解析】细节题。一个设计师很可能因为什么原因被CFW拒绝，根据关键词可回到文中定位至倒数第二段，首句说丹麦的时尚界就有关模特的年龄，健康及其他特性的内容达成一致意见，切一项新法案也明确规定，他们已经意识到时尚界对于人们尤其是年轻人的身体健康所带来的影响，并且该对此负责，接着下一句就说，这一法规的执行方式就是拒绝一些设计师，因为可以推断设计师很可能因为不考虑身体健康因素而被CFW拒绝。

25、【答案】D. A challenge to the Fashion Industry’s Body Ideals

　　【解析】主旨题。本文从首段就开始阐述法国的观点，即时尚界已经失去了定义女性身体之美的权利，且议会也禁止网站通过宣传过度节食来强调过度消瘦。二段继续说明美丽不能只看外表更不能以牺牲健康为代价。三段说女性不该让他人来评判自己的美丽。以及后面的段落中也一直在不断说明一点，即健康很重要，不能只看外表。所以文章最佳标题应该是D，对时尚界完美身材的质疑。

 

**Text 2**

26、【答案】D. is not well reflected in politics

　 【解析】细节题。精读题干，划出关键词。根据题干回到原文精确定位到首段最后一句，该句中的polls民意调查对应题干中的public sentiment，定位答案处为“this has limited political support”，意思为这在政治支持方面是有限的。与D选项“在政治上没有得到很好的反响”为同义替换。

27、【答案】D. largely overshadowed

　 【解析】细节题。根据题干，题干中出现大写the National Trust，定位到第二段首句the National Trust该句。二段首句只是对Hill的该项目做介绍，需向后看影响。往下可以读到Hill’s pressure这句，写到“Hill的项目创造出国家公园和绿地。他们不再制造乡村了，而且每年钢筋混凝土消耗的乡村越来越多。乡村需要持久的保护”。对应选项，该项目的成就很大程度上被夺取了光辉。

28、【答案】A. Ukip may gain from its support for rural conservation

　　【解析】推断题。题干问的是从第三段能推出什么，考察的是相应段落的段落中心。观察选项不难发现，选项中都是大写的Ukip，The Conservatives，The Liberal Democrats，Labour。可根据选项中的大写回段落中寻找，发现Ukip所在的定位句为Only的倒装强调句（倒装强调句往往为答案所在处）。该句子意思是：只有Ukip意识到其机会，并支持这些人。和选项A对应一下，Ukip可能能从其对农村保护的支持中获得好处，是同义替换。

29、【答案】B. Shows his disregard for the character of rural areas

　 【解析】细节题 问的是作者对于奥斯本的偏好（观点）的具体看法。根据关键词奥斯本定位至第五段，因为问的是作者对于奥斯本观点的看法，所以只需要看在奥斯本的观点之后作者的表达内容，第五段倒数两句话就是作者表达自己观点的地方，即“我们没有破坏城市中受到保护的地方”，“你们为什么要破坏乡村的呢？”这就说明奥斯本一方的观点是要破坏乡村环境。所以可得出答案是奥斯本想法表明了他对于乡村人们的忽视。

30、【答案】C. the-town-and-country planning in Britain

　　【解析】根据题干定位到最后一段，问的是作者欣赏赞同什么，作者的观点即是文章末段的段落中心，可定位到末段末句。末句指出，避免this会将左右党派联系起来，this代词指代指代上句中所提到的内容。Should即作者赞同的地方，也就是作者赞同的是城乡结合。

 

**Text 3**

31、【答案】B. Skepticism

　　【解析】作者观点态度题。题干问的是作者对有关CSR方面Milton Friedman的说法是什么态度。根据大写Milton Friedman这个人定位到定位到首段首句。注意题干问的是作者的看法，因此定位到后一句but转折处。转折处的主题句式“things may not absolutely clear-cut”，作者持的是否定态度，选择答案B。C选项是作者态度不明确，不能选择。

32、【答案】 A winning trust from consumers

　　【解析】根据题干找到第二段。根据第二段内容，CSR could add value to their business in three ways。 从而定位下面三点。First后面出现了high quality，但是它是在从句中，从句修饰“signal”，而本句谓语动词是take，与D中 raising 并不是同义词，故排除。Second，和third 都与消费者购买心态有关，和A选项 winning trust from consumers 相对应。而B，C选项的malpractices和defamed在原文中并未出现，且没有同义词，故排除。

33、【答案】 C less severe

　 【解析】根据题干找到第四段对应处。可见题干的 more lenient 是作为修饰 penalties（惩罚） 的，故推测本句在讨论 CSR 和 penalties 有什么联系。而本段与惩罚相关的词只有最后一个词 fines（罚金），修饰它的形容词是lower， 故可推测 more lenient 与降低惩罚有关，只有C选项满足。

34、【答案】A. has an impact on their decision

　　【解析】题干中问的是 CSR record 与 prosecutors evaluate a case 的关系，根据题干内容到对应点：第五段第一句。本句说，。。。they do seem to be influenced by a company‘s recore in CSR。这里的 be influenced 与A选项 has an impact 对应，故选A。 而B选项中的 reliable evidence， C 选项中的 the chance of being penalized 在原文中没有体现。D选项中的 investigation 与题干中的 When prosecutors evaluate a case 明显对应不上，故不予考虑。

35、【答案】B. The necessary amount of companies’ spending on it is unknown

　　【解析】该题是一道判断题，题干问的是有关CSR哪个是对的。先根据CSR回到最后一段，定位到末段首句。首句提到“研究人员承认到其研究没有回答如下问题：公司应该在CSR方面花费多少钱”。选项B的意思是公司在其方面的花费是未知的，属于原文的同义替换。

 

**Text 4**

36、【答案】C. the high cost of operation

　　【解析】因果细节题，问的是纽约时报考虑停止纸质版新闻印刷出版的原因是什么。文章首段首句即是此内容的同义表达，二段解释具体原因，二段二句内容 The infrastructure isn‘t just expensive； it’s excessive at a time when online-only competitors don‘t have the same set of financial constraints。意思是维持纸质印刷的基础设施建设不仅仅是贵，是相当贵， 而他们的竞争对手却没有这样的经济上的限制。

37、【答案】A make strategic adjustments

　　【解析】细节题，问的是面对目前的形势，Peretti建议时代杂志怎么做，根据关键词Peretti回文定位至第四段，首句内容是Peretti说时代杂志不该浪费时间去想着如何停止纸质印刷，而应该找到一种正确的方法去解决这件事。接着二句往后在具体说明该如何正确解决目前的问题。由此推出答案是A 做出策略上的调整。

38、【答案】 B is meant for the most loyal customers

　　【解析】推断题与词汇题的结合，要根据上下文来做出选择。首先定位在第五段最后一句：I would raise prices and make it into more of a legacy product。 不仅要提高价格还要将它变为一种可以传承的产物。单单这一句不足以做出选择。需要继续往下看在第六段中有没有对于这个词的解释之类的。第六段开头提到了他认为most consumer 依旧坚持去相信他们认为好的东西，喜欢的，相信的东西。如果可以每年增加一些比例，那么依旧是可以创收的。长篇大段的叙述可以让大家明白这个词一定跟consumer有关。最为关键的是：紧接着出现了 in  other world， 重述上文，不过却简洁的总结了前文。如果我们要做这些print product， 那就选择那些已经痴迷于他们的人吧。（那么对于他们来讲就是一件可以传承的东西了，以前喜欢，会依旧喜欢下去）。所以这句为做题的关键，对应同义替换，选择B。A选项中的降低成本没有在文中相应位置涉及到。 C重建以往的关荣，与消费者关系不大 D扩大受欢迎程度，范围过大。

39、【答案】B aggressiveness better meets challenges

　 【解析】观点态度题。偏细节题。定位Peretti在文中的观点，首次出现在第三段 overhead…but rushing to eliminate its print edition would be a mistake。并且一直贯穿于下文。我们首先从选项来看。A 中…can stay unaffected 过于绝对，不选。D 选项中legacy business 不是文中的讨论话题，所以可以直接排除。而C选项中谨慎可以促进问题的解决，在perreti的观点中根本没有体现，相反他建议要有所改变，并且要找对方式，言下之意就是大胆去面对挑战。所以最终确定是B。

40、【答案】A Make Your Print Newspaper a Luxury Good

　　【解析】主旨题。出现在最后一道题目中，全文共有7段，根据上面的细节题目，大致可以确定本文的中心词为“print newspaper”B，C 两个选项中的newspaper 都属于范围过大，是主旨题的典型错误选项，而D选项中出现的online newspaper 只是文中print newspaper时提到的一个面临的 一个挑战，不足以引领全文，并且all at once， 是“立刻，马上”之意，与原文的观点也有出入，最终确定选A。

 

**Part B**

41、【答案】 B Decide if the time is right

　 【解析】此段第一句话主句里面说“在过渡的阶段提升自我形象尤其有用”。第二句和第三、四句分别展开说明，第二句表明：如果你处在变动的时期或者感觉需要变动，那么可能这可能是一个好的时机。 相反，第三、四句话表示：如果不确定的话，就需要得到别人的反馈了。也许无需提升。故整段的意思是说要先确定是否现在是提升自我形象的正确时机。故答案为C选项。

42、【答案】F Know your goals

　 【解析】此段中心句即第一句话，标明“要清楚你想要的结果或影响”。其实就是你想要的目标。紧接着开始解释，提到比如，你是否想要更新你的形象？那么，对于一个人来讲，这个目标可能是要被认真对待或者要加强专业的形象。对于其他人，这个目标可能是要被看作可以触摸到的，或者是现代的，或者是时尚的。对于那些要从金融转到广告的，他们可能得看起来更“SOHO”。所以，整段都在讲目标。而选项F中的”goal”形成复现。故为答案。

43、【答案】D Understand the context

　 【解析】复现原则，文章多次重复environment， understand the context 就是要理解你的工作处境。

44、【答案】E Work with professionals

　 【解析】复现原则，文章多次重复professional， work with，就是要与专业人士一起工作。

45、【答案】G Make it efficient

　 【解析】此段第二句句首出现instead， 故为转折句。所以从此句获得中心内容。该句讲的是“最好是将形象升级用做减少做决定的机会。”紧接着提到“选取一套标准的工作服或几个其他的选择。把衣服一下子都买了，而不是一个人购买，或者一次只买一件”。这些提到的都是要有效率。故选G。

46、We don’t have to learn how to be mentally healthy； it is built into us in the same way that our bodies know how to heal a cut or mend a broken bone。

　 【句子结构】分号连接的两个并列句，第一个并列句主干是 We don’t have to learn ，how引导宾语从句做learn的宾语，第二个并列句主干是it is built into us in the same way，that引导定语从句修饰先行词way，that定语从句中主干是our bodies know，how引导宾语从句做know的宾语。

　【参考译文】我们无需刻意去了解学习才能让心理更健康，它正如我们的身体知道怎样让伤口愈合和修复骨折一样，是根植于我们体内的/是我们与生俱来的能力。

47 、Our mental health doesn’t really go anywhere； like the sun behind a cloud， it can be temporarily hidden from view， but it is fully capable of being restored in an instant。

　【句子结构】分号连接的两个并列句， 第一个并列句主谓结构，很简单，第二个并列句中，like the sun behind a cloud是状语，but 连接两个并列分句，包括短语be hidden from 和be capable of。 涉及被动语态的翻译方法。

　【参考译文】我们的心理健康并不是真的消失不见，就像云朵背后的太阳，它也许暂时被遮挡，但是它也可以在瞬间重焕光芒。

48、Mental health allows us to view others with sympathy if they are having troubles， with kindness if they are in pain， and with unconditional love no matter who they are。

　【句子结构】句子主干是 Mental health allows us to view others， 三个并列with 引导的介词短语做状语，前两个with引导的状语中各包含一个if引导的条件状从，最后一个with状语中包含一个no matter 引导的让步状语。

　【参考译文】 心理健康使我们在他人遇到麻烦时给予同情，在他人痛苦时心存善意，而且无论对方是谁都会给予无条件的关爱。

49、【参考译文】尽管拥有健康的心智是我们生活中的万能药，但它并不稀奇，你会发现在你难以做决定时，它一直在指引着你。

　　【句子结构】本题有一个由although引导的让步状语从句，as引导的时间状语从句，以及that引导的宾语从句构成。此处“mental health”若是翻译成心理健康与下文连接，则不符合中文表达习惯，又因mental本身与智力相关，所以将其翻译成“健康的心智”；此外“perfectly ordinary”可以正译，译为“非常普遍”，本译文采取正话反说的方式，译为“并不稀奇”。再次，“difficult decisions”若翻译为困难的决定，不符合中文的表达方式，所以将decision，名词译为动词“做决定”。

50、As you will come to see， knowing that mental health is always available and knowing to trust it allow us slow down to the moment and live life happily。

　　【参考译文】你会慢慢理解到，健康的心智会一直存在，坚信这一点，此刻我们就可以放慢生活节奏，快乐的生活。

　　【句子结构】本题由as 引导的时间状语从句，that引导的宾语从句组成，并且考察代词“it”。“see”在此时了解而不是看到的意思，意思和knowing一致，随意合并翻译；“available”本意“可得到的”，句中意译为“一直存在”。

Notice

　　August 20， 2015

　　To ensure students from oversea to be acquainted with the service of library in Beijing University， we write this notice to inform you of some relevant information about our library。

　　To begin with， our library provides a large amount of books and materials covering not only most majors and subjects， but also many extra-curricular reading materials， thus satisfying all your reading requirements。 Furthermore， the library opens during the week time， each day from 9：00 am to10：00pm.Last but not least， only students enrolled in this university and with a special Library Card are allowed to enter into our library。

　　Anyone interested in studying or reading in our library should sign up their name with their monitor before August 31， and the Library Card will be issued within a week。

　　Library of Beijing University

　　

解析：今年英语一的小作文与我们预测的完全一致，再一次考查到了通知。在英语一的考试当中，通知已经考查过1年。例如我们英语一在2010年就考查过代表研究生会写一篇招募国际会议的通知。同时英语二在2015年考的也是招募志愿者的通知。我们在课堂上也反复强调过通知的格式，所以同学们对此应该毫无压力。

　　同时以图书馆为写作背景，在2007年的建议信中也已经考察过，所以相关表达在课堂上都已经涉及过。因此，只要把2010年通知的格式，结合2007年建议信的相关内容，就可以很轻松的写出2016年的小作文。这就启发我们2017届的同学们要高度重视历年真题，因为考过的话题或是书信类型会反复考查。

　　下面我们来详细解读下今年的小作文，首先看一下题目要求：

　　Suppose you are a librarian in your university。 Write a notice of about 100 words， providing the newly-enrolled international students with relevant information about the library。

　　小作文即A 节作文的评分侧重点在于1。 格式和语域的恰当；2。 信息点的覆盖、3。 内容的组织、4。 语言的准确性。那么我们主要从格式和内容两方面来解析此文。

　　首先，从格式上来说，通知的格式包括四大部分：

　　1。标题， 通知要求必须有标题，可以直接用Notice 做标题就可以，注意首字母大写，居中

　　2。时间， 通知的时间要求在标题下方第二行，按照日月年的顺序来写，注意月与年之间要有逗号，且时间在靠右对齐

　　3。正文， 通知正文要求首段缩进四个字符，不要求一定分段，为了内容层次清晰，建议分三段为好。

　　4。落款，落款即发通知的单位，此处需要特别注意，根据题目的要求，你是代表图书馆写的通知，所以落款应该是某某图书馆，而非Li Ming 本人。

　　另外，从内容上来看，作文一个图书管理员，要向学生介绍学校的图书馆，其实可以介绍的内容还是很多的，比如图书馆的藏书，图书馆的开放时间，入馆要求等等。所以内容部分对于大家来书应该也不是难事，具体内容可以参考如上范文。

【参考范文】

What is symbolically depicted in the caricatures， there emerge two circumstances， carrying sharp contrast implications。 In the first drawing， a father is watching a football match on the sofa who is at the same time supervising his son to finish homework。 It is not difficult to observe that his son wears frowned expression on his face。 On the contrary， the second portrayal depicts a father is working just besides his son， who is doing his assignment。  

　　The objective of the drawer is to demonstrate that utmost significance should be attached to the phenomenon that setting proper examples has exerted great impact on the growth of the younger generation in China at present。 Previously， it is widely acknowledged that it is the compelling obligation for the parents to help their kids to form an appropriate value about the world and the life， which carries overwhelmingly precious connotation to the sound development on the younger generation。 Simultaneously， there is no denying that the most rational method for adults to educate their adolescents is to set themselves a good example to their teenagers rather than making perpetual requirements， which is less persuasive compared with the actions。  

　　Accordingly， it is vital for us to derive positive implication from these thought-provoking drawings。 On the one hand， we can frequently use them to enlighten the parents to be more advisable in educate their children。 On the other hand， parents should attach more emphasis on setting excellent models for their juveniles。 Only by doing so， can we effectively ensure a promising prospect for the adolescents。

 

解析：

2015年的大作文从总体上来看不难，因为它考查到了现在的一个社会热点。这个热点甚至比2014年当时的热点还要热！就内容和话题而言，在我们的预料之中，属于综合性话题，既考察了当今信息社会发展过程中网络对我们生活的影响，正如任何事物有两个方面一样，积极方面和消极方面，必须做到两者的统一，对于手机的影响这个话题大家应该是有话可说的。同时，本题也考查了人际关系方面的内容，同样是两方面内容所引申出来的，这是借用人际关系这个事件来说明和阐述手机的两方面的影响和作用，也就是手机的出现和发展给我们之间的联系提供了方便，使我们的世界变成了地球村，另外比如信息共享，成果共享等都非常方便；除此之外，也有消极的一方面，也就是手机的出现同时淡漠了人际关系，忽视了人与人之间的面对面的交往和联系，同时人们之间面对面说话的交流机会少了，话题也少了。最后说出你的对策。

更重要的是：从十年的考研真题来讲，2009年的大作文考查到了网络的问题，当年的图画是很多人在一个类似大的蜘蛛网的区域里上网，图片下面有一行字：网络的“近”与“远”！当年的描述图画部分比较难表达，而今年图画描述部分相比起来就容易得多。下面我们就从写作的标准三段式来讲讲这三段我们应该怎么写。

第一段图画描述段的写作内容主要是表述图画，四个人都在盯着手机，桌子上的饭菜没动，还可以更加注意写细节，比如他们认真的神情和桌子上的饭菜未动之类！第二段是图画涵义阐释段。本段可分两个方面来具体写。一方面具体写明手机给我们带来的好处；另一方面，我们要指出手机的弊端，给我们生活带来了很多负面影响。第三段评论段的写作内容为给出自己的评论和建议。可以指出年轻人应该重视面对面的交流！最后一句可以展望一下未来，说如果我们放下手机拿起筷子享受美食，和谐的关系就会出现了！

如果同学们指出这个是一个社会问题，我们要加以改正，个人认为这也是可以接受的！

**Section II  Reading Comprehension**

**Part A**

　　Directions:

　　Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET. (40 points)

　

　**Text 1**

　　King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted “kings don’t abdicate, they dare in their sleep.” But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. So, does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days? Does that mean the writing is on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyle?

　　The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. When public opinion is particularly polarised, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above “mere” politics and “embody” a spirit of national unity.

　　It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs’ continuing popularity polarized. And also, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch-infested region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). But unlike their absolutist counterparts in the Gulf and Asia, most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure.

　　Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be, their very history—and sometimes the way they behave today – embodies outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states.

　　The most successful monarchies strive to abandon or hide their old aristocratic ways. Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). Even so, these are wealthy families who party with the international 1%, and media intrusiveness makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image.

　　While Europe’s monarchies will no doubt be smart enough to survive for some time to come, it is the British royals who have most to fear from the Spanish example.

　　It is only the Queen who has preserved the monarchy’s reputation with her rather ordinary (if well-heeled) granny style. The danger will come with Charles, who has both an expensive taste of lifestyle and a pretty hierarchical view of the world. He has failed to understand that monarchies have largely survived because they provide a service – as non-controversial and non-political heads of state. Charles ought to know that as English history shows, it is kings, not republicans, who are the monarchy’s worst enemies.

　　21.  According to the first two Paragraphs, King Juan Carlos of Spain

　　[A] used turn enjoy high public support

　　[B] was unpopular among European royals

　　[C] cased his relationship with his rivals

　　[D]ended his reign in embarrassment

　　22. Monarchs are kept as heads of state in Europe mostly

　　[A] owing to their undoubted and respectable status

　　[B] to achieve a balance between tradition and reality

　　[C] to give voter more public figures to look up to

　　[D]due to their everlasting political embodiment

　　23. Which of the following is shown to be odd, according to Paragraph 4?

　　[A] Aristocrats’ excessive reliance on inherited wealth

　　[B] The role of the nobility in modern democracies

　　[C] The simple lifestyle of the aristocratic families

　　[D]The nobility’s adherence to their privileges

　　24. The British royals “have most to fear” because Charles

　　[A] takes a rough line on political issues

　　[B] fails to change his lifestyle as advised

　　[C] takes republicans as his potential allies

　　[D] fails to adapt himself to his future role

**Text 2**

　　Just how much does the Constitution protect your digital data? The Supreme Court will now consider whether police can search the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant if the phone is on or around a person during an arrest.

　　California has asked the justices to refrain from a sweeping ruling particularly one that upsets the old assumption that authorities may search through the possessions of suspects at the time of their arrest. It is hard, the state argues, for judges to assess the implications of new and rapidly changing technologies.

　　The court would be recklessly modest if it followed California’s advice. Enough of the implications are discernable, even obvious, so that the justices can and should provide updated guidelines to police, lawyers and defendants.

　　They should start by discarding California’s lame argument that exploring the contents of a smart phone — a vast storehouse of digital information — is similar to, say, rifling through a suspect’s purse. The court has ruled that police don’t violate the Fourth Amendment when they sift through the wallet or pocketbook of an arrestee without a warrant. But exploring one’s smart phone is more like entering his or her home. A smart phone may contain an arrestee’s reading history, financial history, medical history and comprehensive records of recent correspondence. The development of “cloud computing,” meanwhile, has made that exploration so much the easier.

　　Americans should take steps to protect their digital privacy. But keeping sensitive information on these devices is increasingly a requirement of normal life. Citizens still have a right to expect private documents to remain private and protected by the Constitution’s prohibition on unreasonable searches.

　　As so often is the case, stating that principle doesn’t ease the challenge of line-drawing. In many cases, it would not be overly onerous for authorities to obtain a warrant to search through phone contents. They could still invalidate Fourth Amendment protections when facing severe, urgent circumstances, and they could take reasonable measures to ensure that phone data are not erased or altered while a warrant is pending. The court, though, may want to allow room for police to cite situations where they are entitled to more freedom.

　　But the justices should not swallow California’s argument whole. New, disruptive technology sometimes demands novel applications of the Constitution’s protections. Orin Kerr, a law professor, compares the explosion and accessibility of digital information in the 21st century with the establishment of automobile use as a virtual necessity of life in the 20th: The justices had to specify novel rules for the new personal domain of the passenger car then; they must sort out how the Fourth Amendment applies to digital information now.

　　26.  The Supreme Court will work out whether, during an arrest, it is legitimate to

　　[A] prevent suspects from deleting their phone contents.

　　[B] search for suspects’ mobile phones without a warrant.

　　[C] check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized.

　　[D]prohibit suspects from using their mobile phones.

　　27.  The author’s attitude toward California’s argument is one of

　　[A] disapproval.

　　[B] indifference.

　　[C] tolerance.

　　[D]cautiousness.

　　28.  The author believes that exploring one’s phone contents is comparable to

　　[A] getting into one’s residence.

　　[B] handling one’s historical records.

　　[C] scanning one’s correspondences.

　　[D] going through one’s wallet.

　　29. The author believes that exploring one’s phone contents is comparable to

　　[A] principles are hard to be clearly expressed.

　　[B] the court is giving police less room for action.

　　[C] citizens’ privacy is not effectively protected.

　　[D] phones are used to store sensitive information.

　　30.  Orin Kerr’s comparison is quoted to indicate that

　　[A] the Constitution should be implemented flexibly.

　　[B] new technology requires reinterpretation of the Constitution.

　　[C]California’s argument violates principles of the Constitution.

　　[D]principles of the Constitution should never be altered

 

**Text 3**

　　The journal Science is adding an extra round of statistical checks to its peer-review process, editor-in-chief Marcia McNutt announced today. The policy follows similar efforts from other journals, after widespread concern that basic mistakes in data analysis are contributing to the irreproducibility of many published research findings.

　　“Readers must have confidence in the conclusions published in our journal,” writes McNutt in an editorial. Working with the American Statistical Association, the journal has appointed seven experts to a statistics board of reviewing editors(SBoRE). Manuscript will be flagged up for additional scrutiny by the journal’s internal editors, or by its existing Board of Reviewing Editors or by outside peer reviewers. The SBoRE panel will then find external statisticians to review these manuscripts.

　　Asked whether any particular papers had impelled the change, McNutt said: “The creation of the ‘statistics board’ was motivated by concerns broadly with the application of statistics and data analysis in scientific research and is part of?Science’s overall drive to increase reproducibility in the research we publish.”

　　Giovanni Parmigiani, a biostatistician at the Harvard School of Public Health, a member of the SBoRE group. He says he expects the board to “play primarily an advisory role.” He agreed to join because he “found the foresight behind the establishment of the SBoRE to be novel, unique and likely to have a lasting impact. This impact will not only be through the publications in Science itself, but hopefully through a larger group of publishing places that may want to model their approach after Science.”

　　John Ioannidis, a physician who studies research methodology, says that the policy is “a most welcome step forward” and “long overdue.” “Most journals are weak in statistical review, and this damages the quality of what they publish. I think that, for the majority of scientific papers nowadays, statistical review is more essential than expert review,” he says. But he noted that biomedical journals such as Annals of Internal Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet pay strong attention to statistical review.

　　Professional scientists are expected to know how to analyze data, but statistical errors are alarmingly common in published research, according to David Vaux, a cell biologist. Researchers should improve their standards, he wrote in 2012, but journals should also take a tougher line, “engaging reviewers who are statistically literate and editors who can verify the process”. Vaux says that Science’s idea to pass some papers to statisticians “has some merit, but a weakness is that it relies on the board of reviewing editors to identify ‘the papers that need scrutiny’ in the first place”.

　　31. It can be learned from Paragraph 1 that

　　[A] Science intends to simplify their peer-review process.

　　[B] journals are strengthening their statistical checks.

　　[C] few journals are blamed for mistakes in data analysis.

　　[D] lack of data analysis is common in research projects.

　　32. The phrase “flagged up” (Para. 2) is the closest in meaning to

　　[A] found.

　　[B] marked.

　　[C] revised.

　　[D] stored.

　　33. Giovanni Parmigiani believes that the establishment of the SBoRE may

　　[A] pose a threat to all its peers.

　　[B] meet with strong opposition.

　　[C] increase Science’s circulation.

　　[D]set an example for other journals.　

\34. David Vaux holds that what Science is doing now

　　[A] adds to researchers’ workload.

　　[B] diminishes the role of reviewers.

　　[C] has room for further improvement.

　　[D]is to fail in the foreseeable future

　　35. Which of the following is the best title of the text?

　　[A] Science Joins Push to Screen Statistics in Papers.

**Text 4**

　　Two years ago, Rupert Murdoch’s daughter ,Elisabeth ,spoke of the “unsettling dearth of integrity across so many of our institutions” Integrity had collapsed, she argued, because of a collective acceptance that the only  “sorting mechanism ”in society should be profit and the market .But “it’s us ,human beings ,we the people who create the society we want ,not profit ”.

　　Driving her point home, she continued: “It’s increasingly apparent that the absence of purpose, of a moral language within government, media or business could become one of the most dangerous foals for capitalism and freedom.” This same absence of moral purpose was wounding companies such as News International ,shield thought ,making it more likely that it would lose its way as it had with widespread illegal telephone hacking .

　　As the hacking trial concludes – finding guilty ones-editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, for conspiring to hack phones ,and finding his predecessor, Rebekah Brooks, innocent of the same charge –the winder issue of dearth of integrity still standstill, Journalists are known to have hacked the phones of up to 5,500 people .This is hacking on an industrial scale ,as was acknowledged by Glenn Mulcaire, the man hired by the News of the World in 2001 to be the point person for phone hacking. Others await trial. This long story still unfolds.

　　In many respects, the dearth of moral purpose frames not only the fact of such widespread phone hacking but the terms on which the trial took place .One of the astonishing revelations was how little Rebekah Brooks knew of what went on in her newsroom, wow little she thought to ask and the fact that she never inquired wow the stories arrived. The core of her successful defence was that she knew nothing.

　　In today’s world, title has become normal that well—paid executives should not be accountable for what happens in the organizations that they run perhaps we should not be so surprised. For a generation, the collective doctrine has been that the sorting mechanism of society should be profit. The words that have mattered are efficiency, flexibility, shareholder value, business–friendly, wealth generation, sales, impact and, in newspapers, circulation. Words degraded to the margin have been justice fairness, tolerance, proportionality and accountability.

　　The purpose of editing the News of the World was not to promote reader understanding to be fair in what was written or to betray any common humanity. It was to ruin lives in the quest for circulation and impact. Ms Brooks may or may not have had suspicions about how her journalists got their stories, but she asked no questions, gave no instructions—nor received traceable, recorded answers.

　　36. According to the first two paragraphs, Elisabeth was upset by

　　[A] the consequences of the current sorting mechanism

　　[B] companies’ financial loss due to immoral practices.

　　[C] governmental ineffectiveness on moral issues.

　　[D]the wide misuse of integrity among institutions.

　　37. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that

　　[A] Glem Mulcaire may deny phone hacking as a crime

　　[B] more journalists may be found guilty of phone hacking.

　　[C] Andy Coulson should be held innocent of the charge.

　　[D] phone hacking will be accepted on certain occasions.

　　38. The author believes the Rebekah Books’s deference

　　[A] revealed a cunning personality

　　[B] centered on trivial issues

　　[C] was hardly convincing

　　[D] was part of a conspiracy

　　39. The author holds that the current collective doctrine shows

　　[A] generally distorted values

　　[B] unfair wealth distribution

　　[C] a marginalized lifestyle

　　[D] a rigid moral cote

　　40. Which of the following is suggested in the last paragraph?

　　[A] The quality of writing is of primary importance.

　　[B] Common humanity is central news reporting.

　　[C] Moral awareness matters in exciting a newspaper.

　　[D] Journalists need stricter industrial regulations.

　　Directions:

　　In the following text, some sentences have been removed. For Questions 41-45, choose the most suitable one from the fist A-G to fit into each of the numbered blanks. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET. (10 points)

　　How does your reading proceed? Clearly you try to comprehend, in the sense of identifying meanings for individual words and working out relationships between them, drawing on your explicit knowledge of English grammar (41) ______you begin to infer a context for the text, for instance, by making decisions about what kind of speech event is involved: who is making the utterance, to whom, when and where.

　　The ways of reading indicated here are without doubt kinds of of comprehension. But they show comprehension to consist not just passive assimilation but of active engagement inference and problem-solving. You infer information you feel the writer has invited you to grasp by presenting you with specific evidence and cues (42) _______

　　Conceived in this way, comprehension will not follow exactly the same track for each reader. What is in question is not the retrieval of an absolute, fixed or “true” meaning that can be read off and clocked for accuracy, or some timeless relation of the text to the world. (43) _______

　　Such background material inevitably reflects who we are, (44) _______This doesn’t, however, make interpretation merely relative or even pointless. Precisely because readers from different historical periods, places and social experiences produce different but overlapping readings of the same words on the page-including for texts that engage with fundamental human concerns-debates about texts can play an important role in social discussion of beliefs and values.

　　How we read a given text also depends to some extent on our particular interest in reading it. (45)_______such dimensions of read suggest-as others introduced later in the book will also do-that we bring an implicit (often unacknowledged) agenda to any act of reading. It doesn’t then necessarily follow that one kind of reading is fuller, more advanced or more worthwhile than another. Ideally, different kinds of reading inform each other, and act as useful reference points for and counterbalances to one another. Together, they make up the reading component of your overall literacy or relationship to your surrounding textual environment.

　　[A] Are we studying that text and trying to respond in a way that fulfils the requirement of a given course? Reading it simply for pleasure? Skimming it for information? Ways of reading on a train or in bed are likely to differ considerably from reading in a seminar room.

　　[B] Factors such as the place and period in which we are reading, our gender ethnicity, age and social class will encourage us towards certain interpretation but at the same time obscure or even close off others.

　　[C] If you are unfamiliar with words or idioms, you guess at their meaning, using clues presented in the contest. On the assumption that they will become relevant later, you make a mental note of discourse entities as well as possible links between them.

　　[D]In effect, you try to reconstruct the likely meanings or effects that any given sentence, image or reference might have had: These might be the ones the author intended.

　　[E]You make further inferences, for instance, about how the test may be significant to you, or about its validity—inferences that form the basis of a personal response for which the author will inevitably be far less responsible.

　　[F]In plays，novels and narrative poems, characters speak as constructs created by the author, not necessarily as mouthpieces for the author’s own thoughts.

　　[G]Rather, we ascribe meanings to test on the basis of interaction between what we might call textual and contextual material: between kinds of organization or patterning we perceive in a text’s formal structures (so especially its language structures) and various kinds of background, social knowledge, belief and attitude that we bring to the text.

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written neatly on the ANSWER SHEET. (10 pionts) 

Within the span of a hundred years, in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, a tide if emigration- one of the great folk wanderings of history- swept from Europe to America. (46) This movement, driven by powerful and diverse motivations, built a nation out of a wilderness and, by its nature, shaped the character and destiny of an uncharted continent. 

(47) The United States is the product of two principal forces- the immigration of European people with their varied ideas, customs, and national characteristics and the impact of a new country which modified these traits. Of necessity, colonial America was a projection of Europe. Across the Atlantic came successive groups of Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Scots, Irishmen, Dutchmen, Swedes, and many others who attempt to transplant their habits and traditions to new world. (48) But the force of geographic conditions peculiar to America, the interplay of the varied national groups upon once another, and the sheer difficulty of maintaining old-world ways in a raw, new continent caused significant changes. These changes were gradual and at first scarcely visible. But the result was a new social pattern which, although it resembled European society in many ways, has a character that was distinctly American. 

(49) The first shiploads of immigrants bound for the territory which is now the United States crossed the Atlantic more than a hundred years after the 15th-and- 16th century explorations of North America. In the meantime, thriving Spanish colonies had been established in Mexico, the West Indies, and South America. These travelers to North America came in small, unmercifully overcrowded craft. During their six-to twelve-week voyage, they survived on barely enough food allotted to them. Many of the ships were lost in storms, many passengers died of disease, and infants rarely survived the journey. Sometimes storms blew the vessels far off their course, and often calm brought unbearably long delay. 

To the anxious travelers the sight of the American shore brought almost inexpressible relief. Said one recorder of events, “ The air at twelve leagues‟ distance smelt as sweet as a new-blown garden.” The colonists‟ first glimpse of the new land was a sight of dense woods. (50) The virgin forest with its richness and variety of trees was a real treasure-house which extended from Maine all the way down to Georgia. Here was abundant fuel and lumber Here was the raw material of houses and furniture, ships and potash, dyes and naval stores.

**2015****年考研英语真题答案解析**

**Section I: Use of English (10 points)**

1、【答案】[D] what
 　　  【解析】该题考查的是语法知识。根据句子结构和选项的特点，可以判断出空格处应填从属连词引导从句;再根据句子的内容，可以看出该从句是一项研究的相关内容(what)，不是指研究的时间(when)， 原因(why)和方式(how)，因此，该题的答案为what。
 　　2、【答案】[B] concluded
 　  　【解析】从此题所在的句子的前后内容可以判断出，that is_______ 中的that是指第一句话的内容(朋友与我们基因上的相关性)，很显然是研究得出的结论。因此，答案为concluded。
 　　3、【答案】[C] on
 　　  【解析】根据空格所在句子的内容(研究对1932分独特的受试者进行分析)判断出进行分析的对象是1932 unique subjects。conduct analysis on…是固定表达。
 　　4、【答案】[A] compared
 　　  【解析】该空格所在的句子是which 引导的定语从句修饰study,意思是：对几对基因不相关的朋友和陌生人进行_______。因为“研究”的内容是关于朋友间基因上的相关性问题，所以完整的意思应该是：对几对基因不相关的朋友和陌生人进行比较。所以最佳答案为compared。
 　　5、【答案】[C] samples
 　  　【解析】根据空格的前后内容判断，到第五个空为止，文章都在讲实验过程，和实验对象，第五个空格所在句子的内容是：相同的人们都用于实验中的这两类______。所以根据上下文语境和内容，应该选与实验对象相对应的samples(样例).因此，答案是samples。
 　　6、【答案】[A] insignificant
 　　  【解析】空的语境为：尽管这1%看起来似乎____，但是遗传学家可不这么认为。空前后形成对比转折的逻辑关系，而从后文列举的例子中可知遗传学家James Fowler对这1%基因的态度是肯定的，故答案为A。
 　　7、【答案】[D] know
 　  　【解析】空的语境为：大多数人甚至不____他们隔三代的表亲，但却设法选择那些____我们亲戚的人作为朋友。填入的词必须满足前后句之间的转折逻辑关系，四个选项带入，只有D选项符合上下文语义。
 　　8、【答案】[A] resemble
 　　  【解析】空的语境为：大多数人甚至不认识他们隔三代的表亲，但却设法选择那些____我们亲戚的人作为朋友。根据全文中心：基因上的相似性，可知本题选择A。
 　　9、【答案】[B] also
 　　  【解析】空所在的句子开头用“The study…”,显然这是对上文话题的继续阐述，前文指出研究发现朋友与我们有1%的基因关系，而空所在句“the genes for smell were something shared in friends”在进一步详细讨论该话题，前后之间是顺接关系，故答案为B。
 　　10、【答案】[D] Perhaps
 　　   【解析】从选项和文字中句子结构可以判断，空格处要求填入一个能够体现前后两个句子逻辑关系的副词，空前的句子谈到“为什么在嗅觉基因方面存在相似性还很难解释”，空后却紧接着对此得出一个相关结论，很明显是矛盾的，所以此结论只能是一种不确定的推测，故答案为D。
 　　11、【答案】[B] to
 　　   【解析】该题为介词选择题。后半句出现比较级，可见是和前文形成比较关系，因此和上半句介词保持一致，用介词to。该句翻译：它(这种相似性)吸引我们到相同的环境，并且使我们更为相似。因此答案为to。
 　　12、【答案】[A] drive
 　   　【解析】该句意思为：很多机制共同作用，从而_____我们选择基因相似的朋友，_____和_____交朋友的“功能关系”。根据上下文可知，此处所填入动词需符合结构_____sb. in doing sth，B选项observe(观察，遵守)和C选项confuse(困惑)均无此用法。符合该结构只有A选项drive(驱使)和D选项limit(限制)。根据上下文可得知：这些机制驱使我们选择基因相似的朋友，符合文章主题。如果选限制则为反向干扰。因此答案为drive。
 　　13、【答案】[B] rather than
 　　   【解析】所填词为逻辑关系短语，空前说选择基因相似的朋友，空后说具有“实用关系”的朋友，可知前后为对立关系，并且根据文章主题，可知肯定前者而否定后者，可锁定B选项rather than。A选项according to(根据)没有体现出对立及取舍关系，因此排除;C选项regardless of(不管)表让步关系，干扰性较强，但文章更强调取前舍后，因此排除;D选项along with(伴随)表顺接，故排除。故答案为rather than。
 　　14、【答案】[D] benefits
 　　   【解析】根据前文functional kinship(实用关系)可得出D选项benefits(利益)，前后形成呼应。A选项chances(机会)、B选项responses(反应)、C选项missions(使命)均不符合题意。故答案为benefits。
 　　15、【答案】[C] faster
 　　   【解析】该句为：evolving ______ than other genes(比其他基因进化得______). 根据同词复现，我们找到该段第二句话中：human evolution picked pace in the last 30,000 years(人类进化在过去30000年间提速)。C 选项faster与下文picked pace(加速)形成呼应，故答案为faster。
 　　16、【答案】[C] understand
 　　   【解析】此题考查动词。根据语意。空格后面是一个why引导的宾语从句，意为“人类进化在过去三万年间得以加速的原因”，表示这一研究的结果和意义。能与这一宾语从句构成搭配的只有C选项understand。A选项forecast“预测”与“过去三万年”相矛盾，B选项remember“记住”和D选项“express”均不符合文意。
 　　17、【答案】[B] contributory
 　　   【解析】此空需要填入一个形容词，表达社会环境对人类进步所起到的作用。help，pick pace这两个词表达的都是积极的含义，因此此处需要填入一个带有褒义的感情色彩的词， 因此排除A选项“不可预测的”和D选项“破坏性的”; B 而C选项“可控的”,与语意无关;因此正确答案为B选项contributory“促进的”。
 　　18、【答案】[D] tendency
 　   　【解析】此处进一步陈述这一研究的结论。A选项endeavor“努力”，B选项“决定”，C选项“安排”，D选项“倾向”。本文的主旨重在解释人们在交朋友的不自觉的一种倾向，而非通过人为的有意识的举动来选择朋友。因此正确答案为D。
 　　19、【答案】[C] ethnic
 　   　【解析】结合文意，人们普遍希望和有相似基因背景的人。C选项ethnic意为“种族的，民族的”，是对上文中多次重复出现的genes,以及下文的the same population的同义复现。因此正确答案为C。 A选项political“政治的”， B选项“宗教的”，D选项“经济的”均不符合原文文意。
 　　20、【答案】[A] see
 　　   【解析】此处考察动词，动词势必要看前后搭配。see that 构成固定词组，意为“务必使……”，符合文意，即：即使所有的受访者都拥有欧洲血统，(研究者们)仍然悉心确保所有的受访者、朋友和陌生人都来自于同一群种。选项B“展示”,选项C“证明”，选项D“辨别”均无此含义，且不符合文意。

 

**Section II Reading Comprehension** 　　**Part A** 　　**Text 1** 　　21、【答案】[D] ended his reign in embarrassment
 　　   【解析】事实细节题。根据题干要求，定位到文章前两段。而文章第一段的第二句话提到“But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down.”(在最近的欧洲选举中，令人尴尬的丑闻和受欢迎的共和党，均迫使Carlos收回前言并退位)。D选项中，“stand down”是“end reign”的同义置换，且“embarrassment”与导致Carlos卸任的原因“embarrassing scandals”是相呼应的。故D是正确答案。A、B、C均属于无中生有。
 　　22、【答案】[A] owing to their undoubted and respectable status
 　　   【解析】事实细节题。根据题干关键词“monarchs”和“heads of state”，定位到第三段的最后一句话“...most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure.”(大多数的王室幸存下来是由于他们让选民可以避免去寻找一个不受争议且受尊敬的公众人物的困难)其中“non-controversial but respected public figure”正是A选项中“undoubted and respectable status”的同义置换。故A是正确答案。
 　　23、【答案】[B] The role of the nobility in modern democracies
 　　   【解析】事实细节题。定位在第四段的最后一句话“...it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states.”(离奇的是，富有的贵族竟然仍是现代民主国家的象征核心)其中，the symbolic heart of modern democratic states是题干the role of the nobility in modern democracies的同义置换。
 　　24、【答案】[D] fails to adapt himself to his future role
 　　   【解析】事实细节题。该题考查：英国皇家贵族们非常害怕是因为查尔斯……。根据题干专有名词Charles可定位到文章第七段“the danger will come with Charles...worst enemies”。本段指出“危险源自于查尔斯，他生活奢靡，等级观念显著;并且他没有意识到君王的幸存很大程度上取决于君王提供了公共服务，同时，查尔斯并不知道，国王才是君主制度最大的敌人，而非共和党人。”选项A意为：对待政治问题态度强硬，文章并无提及;选项B意为，对待建议的生活方式改变失败，文章中提到生活方式，但并未提到改变生活方式;选项C意为：视共和党人为潜在盟友，文章中提到，共和党人并非最大的敌人，并未指明把共和党人视为盟友，属于偷换概念，选项D意为：适应未来身份失败，文章指出查尔斯的生活方式，世界观以及他对于君王制度的错误理解均为身份特殊的他的不正确言行，与选项D表述吻合，故为正确答案。
 　　25、【答案】[C] Carlos, a Lesson for All European Monarchs
 　　    【解析】主旨大意题。该题考察四个选项中哪个可作为文章最佳标题。文章从西班牙国王Carlos退位事件切入，主要讨论当下欧洲君王制度所存在的问题，并非讨论查尔斯的事件，即可排除选项B“查尔斯—继位焦虑”和D“查尔斯—应对威胁缓慢”，而选项A“卡洛斯—荣辱并存” 和C“卡洛斯—欧洲君王们的前车之鉴”中，选项A属于细节信息，不能概括文章大意，选项C可概括，故为正确答案。另外，文章主题词Monarch只有在选项C中出现，也可作为迅速解题的依据。
 　　

**Text 2** 　　26、【答案】[C] check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized
 　　   【解析】这是一道事实细节题，根据题干关键词The Supreme Court回文定位到第一段的第二句话，“The Supreme Court will now consider whether police can search for the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant if the phone is on or around a person during an arrest”,一一比对选项，原文中的“police can search for the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant”与选项C “check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized”是同义替换，其他选项均是无关选项。
 　　27、【答案】[A] disapproval
 　　   【解析】本题是观点态度题，考察作者的态度。根据题干关键词“California’s argument”，可以定位到文章第四段第一句“They should start by discarding California’s lame argument…”。由第四段第一句话中的“discard(抛弃)”和“lame(没有说服力的)”可以看出作者对于California’s argument 是不支持的态度，因此选A。
 　　28、【答案】[A] getting into one’s residence
 　   　【解析】根据题干关键词the author believes和“exploring one’s phone contents is comparable to”可回文定位到文章第四段第三句“But exploring one’s smartphone is more like entering his or her home”，选项A语义与之一致，其中，getting into与entering对应，one’s residence与his or her home对应，故A选项为正确答案。
 　　29、【答案】[C] citizens’ privacy is not effectively protected
 　　   【解析】根据题干信息In paragraphs 5and 6定位第5段第一句话“Americans should take steps to protect their digital privacy.及第6段最后一句话，...and they could take reasonable measures to.....，可推知作者的顾虑，因此答案为C.
 　　30、【答案】[A] the Constitution should be implemented flexibly
 　   　【解析】这是一道例证题，根据题干关键词Orin Kerr可以回文定位到文章最后一段。作者引用Orin Kerr这个人的比较是为了说明相关的论点。分析最后一段结构可知，最后一段的第三句和第四句都是在阐述该例子本身，所以相关论点应该往前面找，即是第二句话，“New，disruptive technology sometimes demands novel applications of the Constitution’s protection”,选项A与之同义替换，其中，be implemented和applications对应，novel和flexibly对应。
 　　

**Text 3** 　　31、【答案】[B] journals are strengthening their statistical checks
 　    　【解析】推理题。根据题干直接定位到第一段。解题关键在于第二句The policy follows similar efforts from other journals(该政策得到其他期刊类似的努力)the policy指第一句The journal Science is adding an extra round of statistical checks to its peer-review process, (《科学》杂志把统计检查额外添加到它的同行评审过程中)，由此可直接推断出正确答案为[B] journals are strengthening their statistical checks (各大期刊正在加强统计数字检查)。选项[A]中simplify与原文语意不符，所以选项C、D属于无中生有。
 　　32、【答案】[C] marked
 　    　【解析】词义题。根据题干定位回第二段第三句Manuscript will be flagged up for additional scrutiny by the journal’s internal editors, (杂志内部编辑将通过更多的审查来标记手稿)。文中运用代入法，把各选项代入句中替换，可知选项C marked(标记)为正确答案。选项A found(发现，找到)，选项B revised(修改)，选项 D stored(存储)。
 　　33、【答案】[D] set an example for other journals
 　　   【解析】细节题。根据题干关键词Giovanni Parmigiani，the establishment of the SBoRE和may定位到第四段的最后一句“… but hopefully through a larger group of publishing places that may want to model their approach after Science。选项中的example是model的同义替换，others journals是原文中a larger group of publishing places的同义替换。
 　　文章中出现了hopefully，表示作者积极的态度。选项A中的threat，选项B中的opposition分别表达负向消极的态度，所以错误。选项C increase Science’s circulation(增加《科学》杂志的发行量)，文章并未提到，属于无中生有。
 　　34、【答案】[C] has room for further improvement
 　   　【解析】细节题。由题干关键词David Vaux和Science，可定位到第六段最后一句。Vaux says that Science’s idea to pass some papers to statisticians “has some merit, but a weakness is that it relies on the board of reviewing editors to identify ‘the papers that need scrutiny’ in the first place”. (《科学》杂志把论文推给统计员审核有一些优点，但缺点是它依赖于审稿编委会首先需要确定审查的文件。)
 　　选项A中workload，选项B. diminish the role of reviewers和选项D中的foreseeable future没有提到，属于无中生有。
 　　35、【答案】A science joins push to screen statistics in papers
 　   　【解析】文章第一段由Science将增加statistical checks引出话题，接下来各段就此问题McNutt, Giovanni Parmigianni, John Ioannidis, David Vaux提出各自的看法。文中statistical，papers反复提及，可知该词是文中核心词。选项B和选项D首先排除，偏离主题，statisticians仅在文中提及，非重点讨论内容;选项C与文中主题相差较大，因此排除。
 　　

**Text 4** 　　36、【答案】[A] the consequences of the current sorting mechanism
 　　   【解析】通过题干可以将此题锁定在前两段。第一段指出Elisabeth谈到了“我们很多机构都面临着令人沮丧的正直感的丧失”。接下来第二句指出这种正直感的丧失是因为大家普遍认为社会中唯一的分类机制(sorting mechanism)应该是利益和市场。而从第一段最后一句我们看出，她认为“应该是我们人类自己创造我们想要的社会，而不应该是利益”。可见，Elisabeth很不认可目前的这种分类机制(sorting mechanism)以及所造成的不良后果，这也正是她感到沮丧的原因。故A选项consequence of the current sorting mechanism(目前这种分类机制的后果)是真正让她沮丧的原因。
 　　37、【答案】[B] more journalists may be found guilty of phone hacking
 　　   【解析】第三段第一句指出，Andy Coulson因为参与手机黑客案件被裁定有罪，然而他的前任却被认定是无罪的。通过这一事件，作者得出由此造成的道德沦丧广泛问题依然存在(the wider issue of dearth of integrity still stands)。即仍然存在一些人没有被裁定有罪。接着文章指出了在新闻业中，已经有记者被认定非法侵入用户手机。而还有一些在等待审判(others await trial)，由此可以推出，将会有更多的记者因为涉及手机黑客案件而被裁定有罪。故正确答案为选项B。
 　　38、【答案】[C] was hardly convincing
 　   　【解析】根据题干中的“defence”可以回文定位到文章第四段最后一句话。该句指出Ms. Brooks辩护成功的关键在于她对这个事件一无所知(she knew nothing)。而作者在该段第一句话中指出，道德丧失不仅体现在普遍存在的手机黑客这一事实上，更体现在一些审判案件所使用的条款上，其中最震惊的就是对Ms. Brooks的审判。可见，作者对该案的审判持否定态度。因此，认为她的辩护是不可信的。故正确答案为C。
 　　39、【答案】[A] (generally distorted values)
 　　   【解析】通过题干中的“collective doctrine”可以直接定位到文中第五段第三行。该句指出“collective doctrine”是社会的分类机制应该是利益。接下来可以看出，那些真正起作用的是那些表示利益的词“efficiency，flexibility，shareholder value，business-friendly，wealth generation…”，而表示公平、正义的词(Justice，fairness，tolerance…)则被置于边缘。可见，这种教义(collective doctrine)只关注利益，而忽略了公平与正义，这显然是一种扭曲的价值观。故A选项正确。
 　　40、【答案】[C] moral awareness matters in editing a newspaper
 　　   【解析】这是一道开放式推理题。作者在最后一段前两句话指出，新闻报道的目的不是为了促进读者的理解，也不是为了追求公平或者违背人类共有的人性，而是通过追求发行量的影响率来破坏人们的生活。即文章从一开始指出的一个问题，为了追求利益而造成了正值感的丧失。从“ruin”一词可以看出，作者对新闻记者的这一行为持否定的态度。并且通过Ms. Brooks女士的行为加以佐证。作者通过正话反说的方式，突出新闻报道过程中正值感的重要性。故正确答案为C，moral awareness matters in editing a newspaper(在新闻报道中，道德意识很重要)，其中moral awareness和integrity是同义互换。
 　　

**Part B** 　　41、【答案】[C] If you are unfamiliar with words or idioms...
 　　   【解析】从首段疑问句可以看出文章主题围绕如何阅读来进行展开。41题空在段中间，需要看空处的前一句和后一句，前一句说的是要去理解单词的含义，并关注句法，而后一句说开始推测文章语境。所以可以推测出41题空处应该说的是单词语义和语境之间的联系，关键词就是words和context。纵览选项，只有C项符合语境和关键词要求，属同词复现，上下文语义逻辑关联。故正确答案选C。
 　　42、【答案】[E] You make further inferences, for instance...

 　　Unfolded in the elaborately painted cartoon is a thought-provoking scene: four youngsters are sitting together to have their gathering feast. However, much of their attention has been attached to their mobile cell phones, totally forgetting what they are gathering for. Just as is put in the caption of this cartoon, it is typically a“Dinner party in mobile era.”
 　　This picture is naturally associated with a wide-spreading phenomenon in contemporary society—too much addiction to the mobile phones. Indeed, we have all stepped into an era of getting and staying in touch with others through telecommunication. Each of us seems close to another under this circumstance, but we have to look at the side-effect of the technology: the high-tech electronic products also cut off the face-to-face communication. To be specific, in our daily life, it’s not uncommon that on buses or subways, or walking on the road, we are all playing with phones or pads for recreation, such as reading novels, watching videos or movies, surfing the Internet, and so on, even though we travel with our friends, parents or loved one.
 　　Evidently, we should take a rational attitude towards this issue, but how? The media should promote the awareness of healthy lifestyle among the public, especially the young. Meanwhile, social activities, either in communities or on campuses, should be launched so that people can get back to the real world.

#  **Text 1**

#  In order to “change lives for the better” and reduce “dependency” George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced the “upfront work search” scheme. Only if the jobless arrive at the jobcentre with a CV, register for online job search, and start looking for work will they be eligible for benefit and then they should report weekly rather than fortnightly. What could be more reasonable?

#   More apparent reasonableness followed. There will now be a seven-day wait for the jobseeker’s allowance. “Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on.” he claimed. “We’re doing these things because we know they help people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get into work faster.” Help? Really? On first hearing, this was the socially concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for the better, complete with “reforms” to an obviously indulgent system that demands too little effort from the newly unemployed to find work, and subsidises laziness. What motivated him, we were to understand, was his zeal for “fundamental fairness”— protecting the taxpayer, controlling spending and ensuring that only the most deserving claimants received their benefits.

#   Losing a job is hurting: you don’t skip down to the jobcentre with a song in your heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your income from the generous state. It is financially terrifying, psychologically embarrassing and you know that support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you are now excluded from the work environment that offers purpose and structure in your life. Worse, the crucial income to feed yourself and your family and pay the bills has disappeared. Ask anyone newly unemployed what they want and the answer is always: a job.

#  But in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into dependency — permanent dependency if you can get it — supported by a state only too ready to indulge your falsehood. It is as though 20 years of ever-tougher reforms of the job search and benefit administration system never happened. The principle of British welfare is no longer that you can insure yourself against the risk of unemployment and receive unconditional payments if the disaster happens. Even the very phrase “jobseeker’s allowance” — invented in 1996 — is about redefining the unemployed as a “jobseeker” who had no mandatory right to a benefit he or she has earned through making national insurance contributions. Instead, the claimant receives a time-limited “allowance,” conditional on actively seeking a job; no entitlement and no insurance, at £71.70 a week, one of the least generous in the EU.

#  

#  21. George Osborne’s scheme was intended to

#  [A]provide the unemployed with easier access to benefits.

#  [B]encourage jobseekers’ active engagement in job seeking.

#  [C]motivate the unemployed to report voluntarily.

#  [D]guarantee jobseekers’ legitimate right to benefits.

#  22. The phrase, “to sign on” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means

#  [A]to check on the availability of jobs at the jobcentre.

#  [B]to accept the government’s restrictions on the allowance.

#  [C]to register for an allowance from the government.

#  [D]to attend a governmental job-training program.

#  23. What prompted the chancellor to develop his scheme?

#  [A]A desire to secure a better life for all.

#  [B]An eagerness to protect the unemployed.

#  [C]An urge to be generous to the claimants.

#  [D]A passion to ensure fairness for taxpayers.

#  24. According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one feel

#  [A]uneasy

#  [B]enraged.

#  [C]insulted.

#  [D]guilty.

#  25. To which of the following would the author most probably agree?

#  [A]The British welfare system indulges jobseekers’ laziness.

#  [B]Osborne’s reforms will reduce the risk of unemployment.

#  [C]The jobseekers’ allowance has met their actual needs.

#  [D]Unemployment benefits should not be made conditional.

#  All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the members of any other profession—with the possible exception of journalism. But there are few places where clients have more grounds for complaint than America.

#  During the decade before the economic crisis, spending on legal services in America grew twice as fast as inflation. The best lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students to pile into law schools. But most law graduates never get a big-firm job. Many of them instead become the kind of nuisance-lawsuit filer that makes the tort system a costly nightmare.

#  There are many reasons for this. One is the excessive costs of a legal education. There is just one path for a lawyer in most American states: a four-year undergraduate degree in some unrelated subject, then a three-year law degree at one of 200 law schools authorized by the American Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar exam. This leaves today’s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts. Law-school debt means that many cannot afford to go into government or non-profit work, and that they have to work fearsomely hard.

#  Reforming the system would help both lawyers and their customers. Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but the state-level bodies that govern the profession have been too conservative to implement them. One idea is to allow people to study law as an undergraduate degree. Another is to let students sit for the bar after only two years of law school. If the bar exam is truly a stern enough test for a would-be lawyer, those who can sit it earlier should be allowed to

#  do so. Students who do not need the extra training could cut their debt mountain by a third.

#  The other reason why costs are so high is the restrictive guild-like ownership structure of the business. Except in the District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of a law firm. This keeps fees high and innovation slow. There is pressure for change from within the profession, but opponents of change among the regulators insist that keeping outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers from the pressure to make money rather than serve clients ethically.

#  In fact, allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would reduce costs and improve services to customers, by encouraging law firms to use technology and to employ professional managers to focus on improving firms’ efficiency. After all, other countries, such as Australia and Britain, have started liberalizing their legal professions. America should follow.

#  26.a lot of students take up law as their profession due to

#  [A]the growing demand from clients.

#  [B]the increasing pressure of inflation.

#  [C]the prospect of working in big firms.

#  [D]the attraction of financial rewards.

#  27.Which of the following adds to the costs of legal education in most American states?

#  [A]Higher tuition fees for undergraduate studies.

#  [B]Admissions approval from the bar association.

#  [C]Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in another major.

#  [D]Receiving training by professional associations.

#  28.Hindrance to the reform of the legal system originates from

#  [A]lawyers’ and clients’ strong resistance.

#  [B]the rigid bodies governing the profession.

#  [C]the stem exam for would-be lawyers.

#  [D]non-professionals’ sharp criticism.

#  29.The guild-like ownership structure is considered “restrictive”partly because it

#  [A]bans outsiders’ involvement in the profession.

#  [B]keeps lawyers from holding law-firm shares.

#  [C]aggravates the ethical situation in the trade.

#  The US$3-million Fundamental physics prize is indeed an interesting experiment, as Alexander Polyakov said when he accepted this year’s award in March. And it is far from the only one of its type. As a News Feature article in Nature discusses, a string of lucrative awards for researchers have joined the Nobel Prizes in recent years. Many, like the Fundamental Physics Prize, are funded from the telephone-number-sized bank accounts of Internet entrepreneurs. These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields, they say, and they want to use their wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in science.

#  What’s not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists quoted in the News Feature. You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels, The new awards are an exercise in self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the achievement-based system of peer-review-led  research. They could cement the status quo of peer-reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed research. They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius.

#  The goals of the prize-givers seem as scattered as the criticism. Some want to shock, others to draw people into science, or to better reward those who have made their careers in research.

#  As Nature has pointed out before, there are some legitimate concerns about how science prizes—both new and old—are distributed. The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, launched this year, takes an unrepresentative view of what the life sciences include. But the Nobel Foundation’s limit of three recipients per prize, each of whom must still be living, has long been outgrown by the collaborative nature of modern research—as will be demonstrated by the inevitable row over who is ignored when it comes to acknowledging the discovery of the Higgs boson. The Nobels were, of course, themselves set up by a very rich individual who had decided what he wanted to do with his own money. Time, rather than intention, has given them legitimacy.

#  As much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear. First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. Second, it is surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere, It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism—that is the culture of research, after all—but it is the prize-givers’ money to do with as they please. It is wise to take such gifts with gratitude and grace.

#  31. The Fundamental Physics Prize is seen as

#  [A]a symbol of the entrepreneurs’ wealth.

#  [B]a possible replacement of the Nobel Prizes.

#  [C]an example of bankers’ investments.

#  [D]a handsome reward for researchers.

#  32. The critics think that the new awards will most benefit

#  [A]the profit-oriented scientists.

#  [B]the founders of the new awards.

#  [C]the achievement-based system.

#  [D]peer-review-led research.

#  33. The discovery of the Higgs boson is a typical case which involves

#  [A]controversies over the recipients’ status.

#  [B]the joint effort of modern researchers.

#  [C]legitimate concerns over the new prizes.

#  [D]the demonstration of research findings.

#  34. According to Paragraph 4,which of the following is true of the Nobels?

#  [A]Their endurance has done justice to them.

#  [B]Their legitimacy has long been in dispute.

#  [C]They are the most representative honor.

#  [D]History has never cast doubt on them.

#  35.The author believes that the now awards are

#  [A]acceptable despite the criticism.

#  [B]harmful to the culture of research.

#  [C]subject to undesirable changes.

#  [D]unworthy of public attention.

# “The Heart of the Matter,” the just-released report by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), deserves praise for affirming the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy in America. Regrettably, however, the report’s failure to address the true nature of the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good.

#  In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken by “federal, state and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others” to “maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education.” In response, the American Academy formed the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences. Among the commission’s 51 members are top-tier-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism.

#  The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because representative government presupposes an informed citizenry, the report supports full literacy; stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. To encourage innovation and competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the crafting of coherent curricula that improve students’ ability to solve problems and communicate effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning to bear on the great challenges of the day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs.

#  Unfortunately, despite 2½ years in the making, "The Heart of the Matter" never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our leading colleges and universities. The commission ignores that for several decades America's colleges and universities have produced graduates who don’t know the content and character of liberal education and are thus deprived of its benefits. Sadly, the spirit of inquiry once at home on campus has been replaced by the use of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles for publicizing “progressive,” or left-liberal propaganda.

#  Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas—such as free markets and self-reliance—as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation.

#  The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its report may well set back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that Congress asked it to illuminate.

#  36. According to Paragraph 1, what is the author’s attitude toward the AAAS’s report?

#  [A] Critical

#  [B] Appreciative

#  [C] Contemptuous

#  [D] Tolerant

#  37. Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS report on how to

#  [A] retain people’s interest in liberal education

#  [B] define the government’s role in education

#  [C] keep a leading position in liberal education

#  [D] safeguard individuals’ rights to education

#  38. According to Paragraph 3, the report suggests

#  [A] an exclusive study of American history

#  [B] a greater emphasis on theoretical subjects

#  [C] the application of emerging technologies

#  [D] funding for the study of foreign languages

#  [B] cautious about intellectual investigation

#  [C] conservative about public policy

# [A] Some archaeological sites have always been easily observable—for example, the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, the pyramids of Giza in Egypt; and the megaliths of Stonehenge in southern England. But these sites are exceptions to the norm. Most archaeological sites have been located by means of careful searching, while many others have been discovered by accident. Olduvai Gorge, an early hominid site in Tanzania, was found by a butterfly hunter who literally fell into its deep valley in 1911. Thousands of Aztec artifacts came to light during the digging of the Mexico City subway in the 1970s.

#  [B]In another case, American archaeologists Rene Million and George Cowgill spent years systematically mapping the entire city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico near what is now Mexico City. At its peak around AD 600, this city was one of the largest human settlements in the world. The researchers mapped not only the city’s vast and ornate ceremonial areas, but also hundreds of simpler apartment complexes where common people lived.

#  [C] How do archaeologists know where to find what they are looking for when there is nothing visible on the surface of the ground? Typically, they survey and sample (make test excavations on) large areas of terrain to determine where excavation will yield useful information. Surveys and test samples have also become important for understanding the larger landscapes that contain archaeological sites.

#  [D] Surveys can cover a single large settlement or entire landscapes. In one case, many researchers working around the ancient Maya city of Copan, Honduras, have located hundreds of small rural villages and individual dwellings by using aerial photographs and by making surveys on foot. The resulting settlement maps show how the distribution and density of the rural population around the city changed dramatically between AD 500 and 850, when Copan collapsed.

#  [E] To find their sites, archaeologists today rely heavily on systematic survey methods and a variety of high-technology tools and techniques. Airborne technologies, such as different types of radar and photographic equipment carried by airplanes or spacecraft, allow archaeologists to learn about what lies beneath the ground without digging. Aerial surveys locate general areas of interest or larger buried features, such as ancient buildings or fields.

#  [F] Most archaeological sites, however, are discovered by archaeologists who have set out to look for them. Such searches can take years. British archaeologist Howard Carter knew that the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun existed from information found in other sites. Carter sifted through rubble in the Valley of the Kings for seven years before he located the tomb in 1922. In the late 1800s British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evan combed antique dealers’ stores in Athens, Greece. He was searching for tiny engraved seals attributed to the ancient Mycenaean culture that dominated Greece from the 1400s to 1200s BC. Evans’s interpretations of these engravings eventually led him to find the Minoan palace at Knossos (Knossós) on the island of Crete, in 1900.

#  [G] Ground surveys allow archaeologists to pinpoint the places where digs will be successful. Most ground surveys involve a lot of walking, looking for surface clues such as small fragments of pottery. They often include a certain amount of digging to test for buried materials at selected points across a landscape. 

# Archaeologists also may locate buried remains by using such technologies as ground radar, magnetic-field recording, and metal detectors. Archaeologists commonly use computers to map sites and the landscapes around sites. Two and three-dimensional maps are helpful tools in planning excavations, illustrating how sites look, and presenting the results of archaeological research.

#      Music means different things to different people and sometimes even different things to the same person at different moments of his life. It might be poetic, philosophical, sensual, or mathematical, but in any case it must, in my view, have something to do with the soul of the human being. Hence it is metaphysical; but the means of expression is purely and exclusively physical: sound. I believe it is precisely this permanent coexistence of metaphysical message through physical means that is the strength of music. (46)It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words, all we can do is articulate our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself.

#      Beethoven’s importance in music has been principally defined by the revolutionary nature of his compositions. He freed music from hitherto prevailing conventions of harmony and structure. Sometimes I feel in his late works a will to break all signs of continuity. The music is abrupt and seemingly disconnected, as in the last piano sonata. In musical expression, he did not feel restrained by the weight of convention. (47)By all accounts he was a freethinking person, and a courageous one, and I find courage an essential quality for the understanding, let alone the performance, of his works.

#      This courageous attitude in fact becomes a requirement for the performers of Beethoven’s music. His compositions demand the performer to show courage, for example in the use of dynamics. (48)Beethoven’s habit of increasing the volume with an intense crescendo and then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage was only rarely used by composers before him.

#      Beethoven was a deeply political man in the broadest sense of the word. He was not interested in daily politics, but concerned with questions of moral behavior and the larger questions of right and wrong affecting the entire society. (49)Especially significant was his view of freedom, which, for him, was associated with the rights and responsibilities of the individual: he advocated freedom of thought and of personal expression.

#      Beethoven’s music tends to move from chaos to order as if order were an imperative of human existence. For him, order does not result from forgetting or ignoring the disorders that plague our existence; order is a necessary development, an improvement that may lead to the Greek ideal of spiritual elevation. It is not by chance that the Funeral March is not the last movement of the Eroica Symphony, but the second, so that suffering does not have the last word. (50)One could interpret much of the work of Beethoven by saying that suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth living.

**Section II Reading Comprehension**
 **Part A**

真题解析：文章概括：政府大臣Grorge Osbome提出了一个项目帮助失业的人找工作。
 **Text 1** 21、【答案】[B]encourage jobseekers’ active engagement in job seeking.　 

【解析】细节题。本道题的关键是intended to问的是目的，所以我们也应该去寻找体现目的性的词汇，所以在首段首句看到了in order to ,则后面的内容即为本题答案，结合后面找工作的内容则选择B选项。

22．【答案】[C]to register for an allowance from the government.
  　 【解析】词义句意题。先根据题干定位到第二段第三行，to sign on前面有一个很明显的not，则我们可以推知，这一定是前面的反义，我们只要读懂前面半部分就可以了，前面说应该spend looking for work，正好和A选项相符，所以我们只要选择一个相反的选项即可，则选择C选项。
 \23. 【答案】[A]A desire to secure a better life for all.

【解析】细节题。本道题的关键是题目中的prompted和chancellor，根据chancellor能定位到二段第五行，再向下寻找则可发现motivate和prompt是对应的，所以看本句即可发现和A选项是对应的。
 \24. 【答案】[A]uneasy.
  　 【解析】细节题。本道题根据unemployed回到文中定位在第三段的最后一句，没有感觉相关内容，所以需要向前找答案，再根据本段第一句话中的losing a job即可判定答案在第二句，因此选择A选项。另我们会发现BCD三个选项趋于强烈和负面，所以，我们选择A选项。
 \25. 【答案】[B]Osborne’s reforms will reduce the risk of unemployment.

【解析】本题题根据选项定位。A选项根据大写字母The British welfare system定位到最后一段的第三句，原文是“no longer”，选项与原文反向干扰。B选项根据Osborne’s reforms
 定位到第一段第二句，可以得出该项目可减少失业危险，所以B为正确答案。C选项根据题干“the jobseekers’ allowance”定位到最后一段倒数第二句，该句提到“no fundamental right”，恰与C选项表意相反，所以C是反向干扰。D选项根据题干“conditional”定位到最后一段最后一句，其中只提到“conditional on actively seeking a job…”，并没有要说以后应该怎样，所以属于无中生有。

 

**Text 2**

\26. 【答案】[D]the attraction of financial rewards.

【解析】该题是因果细节题，考察细节。首先，根据段落定位原则模糊定位，定位到前几段。其次，再精确定位，题干中有关键词“students”“law”“profession”，回到原文寻找相关信息。第一段未发现相关信息，然后到第二段看到“The best lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students to pile into law schools.”与题干有重合之处，选项D是该句的同义替换。A、B、C三个选项根据原文个别词汇“clients”“inflation”“big-firm”等进行干扰。注意，第一段的But是个假转折词，并非答案处。
 \27. 【答案】[C]Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in another major.

【解析】该题是细节题，考察细节。首先根据段落定位原则定位到第三段。其次，根据题干关键词“the costs of legal education”精确定位到第三段第二句话“One is the excessive costs of a legal education.”问题是“which of the following adds to the costs of legal education”，因此定位句的下一句就是答案，即“There is just one path for a lawyer in most American states: a four-year undergraduate degree in some unrelated subject, then a three-year law degree at one of 200 law schools accredited by the American Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar exam.”分析选项可知，选项C恰当概况了该句子的涵义。A选项利用三段末尾的“This leaves today’s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts.”进行干扰。B选项无中生有。D选项根据四段最后一句出现的“training”个别词汇进行干扰。
 28.【答案】[B]the rigid bodies governing the profession.
 　  【解析】该题是原因细节题，问来源。首先段落定位原则定位到第四段。其次，根据题干关键词“the reform of the legal system”定位到第二句“Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but the state-level bodies that govern the profession have been too conservative to implement them.”选项B即为该句的同义替换。
 \29. 【答案】[A]bans outsiders’ involvement in the profession.

【解析】该题为因果细节题，问原因。根据段落定位原则定位至倒数第二段。其次，题干中出现“the guild-like ownership structure”，精确定位到第二句“Except in the District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of a law firm. This keeps fees high and innovation slow.”此外，在该段最后一句提到“…keeping outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers from the pressure to make money rather than serve clients ethically.”从而可以得出答案选A。
 \30. 【答案】[C]a problem in America’s legal profession and solutions to it.

【解析】该题为文章主旨题，考察文章中心。该篇文章属于问题解决型文章，前5段均在说美国法律职业存在的问题，最后一段提出了解决措施“allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would reduce costs and improve services to customers, by encouraging law firms to use technology and to employ professional managers to focus on improving firms’ efficiency.”。因此，该篇属于问题解决型文章，选C。其他几个选项均为文中的个别细节，以偏概全。

 

**Text 3**

真题解析：
 文章主题及背景知识：此篇阅读的主题内容为“基础物理学奖”，如果对于这一背景信息有所了解，这篇文章便可轻松看懂，做题更是十拿九稳!与2013年相比，2014考研阅读文章同样注重时效性，Text3便是反应了2013年3月份的一次实时事件：基础物理学基金会于3月20日晚在瑞士日内瓦揭晓了2013年基础物理学奖!所以2015考研的同学们一定要多多关注社会热点话题，拓展视野，丰富自己的文化背景知识，这样才能取得事半功倍的效果!
 文章讲到的是关于和诺贝尔奖一样的奖金丰厚的奖项出现，这些奖项就是由一些网络的公司或者是一些新贵们他们得出这样大量的钱，当然会遭出一些批评，这些奖项还是没法和诺贝尔奖相比的，阶级是没法改变的，名望是没法购买的。当然这一系列的东西，在前三段当中谈到之后，到了最后一段，作者表明他的观点，纵然这些对科学家的奖励在奖项上存在着一些瑕疵，存在着一些不合理的地方。但是对于科学家来说，有人给你钱支持你的研究，终归是好的。也就是说从31到35题基本上没有难题，也没有可以去争议的，也是既所得的文章。
 \31. 【答案】[A]a symbol of the entrepreneurs’s wealth. 
 　　【解析】细节题。根据题干中的Fundamental Physics Prize可以定位到第一段，但除此之外就没有其他细节提示信息了，所以我们只能根据几个选项去定位，分别根据选项中的entrepreneurs、Nobel Prize、investment、reward去定位，在第一段末句找到了与A选项相一致的句子，则判定A选项正确。
 \32. 【答案】[B]the founders of the new award.

【解析】 细节题。根据题干中的critics定位到第三段，可知第二段没有出题，从第三段第二句可以得出本道题的正确选项，who have made their careers in research即为B选项中的The founders。
 \33. 【答案】[D]the demonstration of research findings.　

【解析】 细节题。本道题如果从题干中看更像是例证题，但题目中说道the case involves即问例子本身，所以为一道细节题。我们在第四段倒数第三句中找到了Higgs boson，定位到本句可以得知nature of modern research---as well as demonstrated by……即为本道题正确答案。
 \34. 【答案】[A]Their endurance has done justice to them.

【解析】判断题。此类题型是考试中的一个难点，在题干中提示信息非常少，所以我们需要根据每个选项分别定位。A选项的durance定位到本段最后一句time。B选项根据legitimacy定位到第一句。C选项没有提到。D选项从最后一段可以验证确实是收到了质疑，B选项和原文不符，可以得知答案为A。
 \35. 【答案】[A]acceptable despite the criticism.

【解析】主旨题。本题属于作者观点，出在最后一段则说明更多体现了文章的主旨，因为还有一个段落对应，则我们可以在最后一段找答案，根据题干中的award我们可以得知全文的最后一句明确体现了作者的观点，故选A。
 
 **Text 4**

本篇文章选自华尔街日报。主要讲的是非自由教育以及”问题核心”这个报告。
 \36. 【答案】[A] Critical

【解析】细节态度题。并非考察全文的态度，也就是说要细节定位。根据题干定位原则，定位第一段AAAS出现之处，并且一定要找到表示评价的部分。该题迷惑性很强，因为文章在AAAS后面就又”praise”所以容易误导大家选择答案B “appreciative(欣赏的)”，但是我们应该看到有however，我们知道如果第一段出现转折，那此转折一定跟主旨有关。同时各个题都与主旨相关，所以这道题应该于主旨相关，后文中的“may cause more harm than good.”让我们知道它的还多余利，所以答案选择A，批判性的。
 \37. 【答案】[C] keep a leading position in liberal education

【解析】细节题。根据自然段定位原则，36题在第一段出题，38题在第三段出题，那37题在第二段出题的可能性就很大。同时题干定位”Influential figures in the Congress”与“leading congressional Democrats and Republicans”同义替换。定位的答案是asking that it identify actions that could be taken by "federal, state and ….., individual benefactors and others" to "asking that it identify actions that could be taken by "federal, state and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others" to "maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education. “In humanities and social scientific scholarship and education. “也就是说答案重点在maintain national excellence 刚好与选项C 中的leading position 进行同义替换。ABD与文章不符合。
 \38. 【答案】[C] the application of emerging technologies

【解析】推理题。Suggest 是推理题的标志。先化选项关键词，发现选项A是讲American history选项B; 是讲theoretical subjects;选项C]emerging technologies;选项Dfunding foreign languages。返回原文定位的时候，A 选项中的“exclusive 排外”并没有在“stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government;”这句话中体现。B选项中的理论学科没有定位点。D选项与原文“increased funding for teachers”以及“greater study of foreign languages,”不符。属于张冠李戴。“encourages the use of new digital technologies.”与选项C 同义替换。
 \39. 【答案】[B] cautious about intellectual investigation

【解析】属于推理题。Implies是推理题的标志。同时根据提题干定位第五段，找professor. “professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas—such as free markets, self-reliance —as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation.”A 选项中的free markets前面的修饰词语是conservative or liberal ideas 没有体现A 选项中的supportive。C选项中的conservative 与文中progressive public policy 不符合。D选项中biased 没有体现，故排除。所以选B。
 \40. 【答案】[B] Illiberal Education and “The Heart of the Matter”

【解析】主旨大意题。先看其他题题干，我们锁定关键词是report ，而report 就是“the heart of the matter “ 故排除C和D.而我们看A 发现文章并没有讲如何抓住“问题核心”的各个方法。排除A，选择B


 **Part B**

解析：本文选自发表于2003年The International History Project的文章，题目为Archeology.
 \41. 【答案】[C]

【解析】此题是首段，所以需要找寻综述性的段落。其中A和E选项是给出的，所以只需从余下选项进行选择。B选项中有another，所以不会是第一段。E选项中代词their没有指代对象。F中有however,也不会是第一段。因此，只留下C和D选项。在C选项最后一句提到survey和test sample也很重要。而在D选项开头就提到了survey,而且整段都是，由此可看出D是对C的分述。所以C是首段。
 \42. 【答案】[F]

【解析】此题排在A项之后，所以内容上应该是衔接的。A项主要谈论的是大部分考古地点是通过仔细搜寻之后找到的，而其他的很多是被偶然发现的，接着举了一些例子。接下来在看各段首句的时候，发现F项中提到大部分考古地点是被考古学家们特意寻找发现的，和A提到的偶然发现意思相反，所以F正确。
 \43. 【答案】[G]

【解析】此题排在E项之后。E选项最后一句提到天空的搜寻，而在G选项的开头提到地面搜寻，正好形成对应，所以为正确答案。
 \44. 【答案】[D]

【解析】此时，只留下B和D选项。其中B选项开头提到了in another case,所以前面一段一定要提到in one case, 而D选项中有in one case.所以，D选项在前。
 \45. 【答案】[B]

【解析】根据上面的分析，此题只能选B。 
 **Part C**

\46. It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words, all we can do is articulate our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself.
 【句型分析】本句主句主干为it is the reason，why引导定语从句，修饰the reason。定语从句的主干是all we can do is articulate our reactions and not grasp music itself，其表语是不定式短语，由于主语中含有do，不定式符号to省略：articulate our reactions and not grasp music itself。our reactions之后to it为其定语，it指代music。定语从句中还包含when引导的时间状语从句。
 【翻译要点】①本句主干的主句是主系表结构，reason后why引导的定语从句较长，翻译时可以与主干部分结合，调整表达为：这也就是为什么….。
 ②定语从句中，when引导时间状语从句，其中with words做状语，翻译时需调整语序到其修饰的to describe之前，可以表达为“当我们尝试用语言来描述音乐时”。定语从句的主干顺译即可，其中reaction根据语境，可以翻译为“感受”，其定语to it在表达时前置，it指代还原为“音乐”，则可以翻译为“所有我们能做的，就是明确表达我们对于音乐的感受”，或者调整表达为“我们只能明确表达我们对于音乐的感受”。and之后，grasp依据语境，需要翻译为“理解”。
 【译文总结】这也是为什么当我们试图用语言来描述音乐时，我们只能明确表达我们对于音乐的感受，而不能完全理解音乐本身。
 
 \47. By all accounts he was a freethinking person, and a courageous one, and I find courage an essential quality for the understanding, let alone the performance, of his works.
 【句型分析】本句为并列句。第一个分句he was a freethinking person, and a courageous one，句首by all accounts为固定搭配，意思是“根据各方面说”。第二个分句的主干为I find courage an essential quality，其中宾语为courage，而an essential quality是宾语补足语。quality后介词短语for the understanding of his work为其定语，其中还包含一个插入结构let alone the performance。
 【翻译要点】① 第一个分句结构比较简单，句首固定搭配by all accounts，可以调整表达，翻译为“据大家所说”。主干顺译即可，其中he指代“贝多芬”，one指代person。这一部分可以翻译为“贝多芬是个思想自由、充满勇气的人”。
 ②第二个分句，主干为“我发现勇气是一个关键品质”，quality后为其定语for the understanding of his work，其中the understanding of his work意思为“对于其作品的理解”，做词性转化后，可以表达为“理解其作品”，这个介词短语需要调整语序前置于quality，可以翻译为“理解他作品的关键品质”，则第二个分句可以表达为“我发现勇气，是理解他作品的关键品质”。还可以调整表达为“我发现勇气这一品质，是理解他作品的关键”。
 ③在定语for the understanding of his work中的插入成分，在逻辑上let alone并列the understanding和the performance，二者共用定语of his works，顺译句末即可：更不必说是演出其作品的关键品质。
 【译文总结】人们普遍认为，他(贝多芬)是个思想自由、充满勇气的人，我发现勇气这一品质，是理解他作品的关键，更不必说是演出其作品的关键。
 
 \48. Beethoven’s habit of increasing the volume with an extreme intensity and then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage was only rarely used by composers before him.
 【句型分析】本句主干为Beethoven’s habit was used by composers before him。本句的谓语为被动语态，主语habit后介词短语of increasing the volume with an extreme intensity and then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage为其定语，是由介词of与and并列的两个动名词短语increasing the volume with an extreme intensity 和then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage构成。
 【翻译要点】①本句主干较为简单，但是主语habit后有很长的后置定语：Habit of increasing the volume…，其中“habit”可以词性转换为动词“习惯”，而中文常常先表达次要信息，则这一部分可以翻译一句话“贝多芬习惯增加…”，置于句首。第一个动名词短语中，with an extreme intensity为状语，表达时需调整语序到其修饰的increasing the volume前，根据语境，volume意思为“音量”，则increasing可以翻译为“增高”。这一部分可以翻译为“最大限度来逐渐增高音量”。第二个动名词短语then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage，状语with a sudden soft passage需调整到following it前表达，其中passage根据语境，意思为“乐段”。则这一部分可以表达为“然后突然跟上轻柔的乐段”。整合本句主语与其定语，可以翻译为“贝多芬习惯最大限度来逐渐增高音量，然后突然跟上轻柔的乐段”。
 ②本句主干意思为“在他之前，作曲家很少使用贝多芬的习惯”。中文语义重心在后，将本部分翻译在句末即可。由于前句译文已经提到这种习惯，则这部分可以表达为“在他之前，作曲家很少使用这种习惯”，结合语境还可以表达为“在他之前，作曲家很少使用这种方式”，或者“在他之前，只有极个别作曲家会使用这种方式”。
 【译文总结】贝多芬习惯最大限度来逐渐增高音量，然后突然跟上轻柔的乐段，在他之前，作曲家很少使用这种方式。
 
 49) Especially significant was his view of freedom, which, for him, was associated with the rights and responsibilities of the individual: he advocated freedom of thought and of personal expression.
 【句型分析】本句为完全倒装，主句的主干是his view of freedom was Especially significant。
 his view of freedom后为which引导的非限定性定语从句，修饰freedom，关系代词which在定语从句中作主语。of the individual修饰the rights and responsibilities，冒号后进行解释说明。
 【翻译要点】
 ① 本句主干为完全倒装，但是在翻译时，顺译即可，其中his指代“贝多芬的”，主干可以表达为：尤为重要的是，他(贝多芬)对于自由的看法….。
 ② which引导英语从句，修饰freedom，表达时翻译成另一句话“对于他而言，这种自由是与个人的权利和责任联系起来的”，其中for him还可以调整表达为“他认为”。
 ③冒号后进行解释，可以翻译为：他倡导思想自由和个人言论自由。
 【译文总结】尤为重要的是贝多芬对于自由的看法，他认为，这种自由是与个人的权利和责任联系起来的：他倡导思想自由和个人言论自由。
 
 \50. One could interpret much of the work of Beethoven by saying that suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth living.

**Section III Writing**
 **Part A**

Dear Mr. President,

I am writing to put forward some suggestions concerning the ways to improve student’s physical condition in your university. My proposals are as the following.

First and foremost, I propose that we should take advantages of physical education classes on our campus, and not only educate students to realize the significance of the classes, but also to encourage students to take an active part in the classes. More importantly, we should attach importance to the role played by extra-curricular activates. For example, we could plan and organize a large number of such ball games as football games, basketball games and so on. 

It’s my honor to share my opinions concerned with you. If you could take my advice into consideration, I will be highly grateful.

​                                           Sincerely yours,

​                                               Li Ming

 

**Part B**

As is shown above, in the first picture, along the road walked a young and vigorous mother, leading her girl hand in hand, with smile on her face three decades ago, while nowadays the daughter in the prime of her life guided her aged mother through the road arm in arm in the second picture. Recently there is a heated discussion about these pictures on Wei bo. Simple as they are, the meaning behind is as deep as ocean. 

The meaningful drawing mirrors a common phenomenon in contemporary society that there is the positive influence of fealty. It is universally acknowledged that supporting the aged is the responsibility of the sons and daughters of the Chinese people. First of all, emphases should be given to the cultivation of young children on respecting and loving the elders, which is undoubtedly an essential factor of this phenomenon. In addition, our government should take joint efforts to carry out effective measures on how to punish those who abuse the elders. Last but not the least, every individuals should keep deep in mind that it is the elders that contributed a lot to the rapid development of our society.

Given all the above arguments, I take the attitude that, first of all, we should show filial piety to parents who bring us to maturity. More importantly, the public should embrace and promote the awareness of filial duty which is importance for a more active and healthy society. In conclusion, filial piety, as a traditional Chinese virtue, is indispensable for us living a more valuable and fulfilling life.

## Section Ⅱ Reading Comprehension

### 　　Part A

　　Directions：Read the following four texts. Answer the questions after each text by choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1. (40 points)

　　**Text 1**

　　In the 2006 film version of The Devil Wears Prada, Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, scold her unattractive assistant for imagining that high fashion doesn’t affect her. Priestly explains how the deep blue color of the assistant’s sweater descended over the years from fashion shows to department stores and to the bargain bin in which the poor girl doubtless found her garment.

　　This top-down conception of the fashion business couldn’t be more out of date or at odds with feverish world described in Overdressed, Elizabeth Cline’s three-year indictment of “fast fashion”. In the last decades or so, advances in technology have allowed mass-market labels such as Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo to react to trends more quickly and anticipate demand more precisely. Quckier turnrounds mean less wasted inventory, more frequent releases, and more profit. Those labels encourage style-conscious consumers to see clothes as disposal—— meant to last only a wash or two, although they don’t advertise that——and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks. By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking all industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.

　　The victims of this revolution, of course, are not limited to designers. For H&M to offer a 5.95 knit miniskirt in all its 2300-plus stores around the world, it must rely on low-wage, overseas labor, order in volumes that strain natural resources, and use massive amount of harmful chemicals.

　　Overdressed is the fashion world’s answer to consumer activist bestsellers like Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma. Mass-produced clothing, like fast food, fills a hunger and need, yet is non-durable, and wasteful,” Cline argues, Americans, she finds, buy roughly 20 billion garments a year——about 64 items per person——and no matter how much they give away, this excess leads to waste.

Towards the end of Overdressed, Cline introduced her ideal, a Brooklyn woman named SKB, who, since 2008 has make all of her own clothes——and beautifully. But as Cline is the first to note, it took Beaumont decades to perfect her craft; her example, can’t be knocked off.

　　Though several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on labor and the environment——including H&M, with its green Conscious Collection Line——Cline believes lasting-change can only be effected by the customer. She exhibits the idealism common to many advocates of sustainability, be it in food or in energy. Vanity is a constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can’t afford to it.

　　21. Priestly criticizes her assistant for her

　　[A] poor bargaining skill.

　　[B] insensitivity to fashion.

　　[C] obsession with high fashion.

　　[D]lack of imagination.

　　22. According to Cline, mass-maket labels urge consumers to

　　[A] combat unnecessary waste.

　　[B] shut out the feverish fashion world.

　　[C] resist the influence of advertisements.

　　[D] shop for their garments more frequently.

　　23. The word “indictment” (Line 3, Para.2) is closest in meaning to

　　[A] accusation.

　　[B] enthusiasm.

　　[C] indifference.

　　[D] tolerance.

　　24. Which of the following can be inferred from the lase paragraph?

　　[A] Vanity has more often been found in idealists.

　　[B] The fast-fashion industry ignores sustainability.

　　[C] People are more interested in unaffordable garments.

　　[D] Pricing is vital to environment-friendly purchasing.

　　25. What is the subject of the text?

　　[A] Satire on an extravagant lifestyle.

　　[B] Challenge to a high-fashion myth.

　　[C] Criticism of the fast-fashion industry.

　　[D] Exposure of a mass-market secret.

　　

**Text 2**

　　An old saying has it that half of all advertising budgets are wasted-the trouble is, no one knows which half . In the internet age, at least in theory ,this fraction can be much reduced . By watching what people search for, click on and say online, companies can aim “behavioural” ads at those most likely to buy.

　　In the past couple of weeks a quarrel has illustrated the value to advertisers of such fine-grained information: Should advertisers assume that people are happy to be tracked and sent behavioural ads? Or should they have explicit permission?

In December 2010 America's Federal Trade Cornmission (FTC) proposed adding a "do not track "(DNT) option to internet browsers ,so that users could tell adwertisers that they did not want to be followed .Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari both offer DNT ;Google's Chrome is due to do so this year. In February the FTC and Digltal Adwertising Alliance (DAA) agreed that the industry would get cracking on responging to DNT requests.

　　On May 31st Microsoft Set off the row: It said that Internet Explorer 10,the version due to appear windows 8, would have DNT as a default.

　　It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. Geting a DNT signal does not oblige anyone to stop tracking, although some companies have promised to do so. Unable to tell whether someone really objects to behavioural ads or whether they are sticking with Microsoft’s default, some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.

　　Also unclear is why Microsoft has gone it alone. Atter all, it has an ad business too, which it says will comply with DNT requests, though it is still working out how. If it is trying to upset Google, which relies almost wholly on default will become the norm. DNT does not seem an obviously huge selling point for windows 8-though the firm has compared some of its other products favourably with Google's on that count before. Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's chief privacy officer, bloggde:"we believe consumers should have more control." Could it really be that simple?

　　26. It is suggested in paragraph 1 that “behavioural” ads help advertisers to:

　　[A] ease competition among themselves

　　[B] lower their operational costs

　　[C] avoid complaints from consumers

　　[D]provide better online services

　　27. “The industry” (Line 6,Para.3) refers to:

　　[A] online advertisers

　　[B] e-commerce conductors

　　[C] digital information analysis

　　[D]internet browser developers

　　28. Bob Liodice holds that setting DNT as a default

　　[A] many cut the number of junk ads

　　[B] fails to affect the ad industry

　　[C] will not benefit consumers

　　[D]goes against human nature

　　29. which of the following is ture according to Paragraph.6?

　　[A] DNT may not serve its intended purpose

　　[B] Advertisers are willing to implement DNT

[C] DNT is losing its popularity among consumers

　　[D] Advertisers are obliged to offer behavioural ads

　　30. The author's attitude towards what Brendon Lynch said in his blog is one of:

　　[A] indulgence

　　[B] understanding

　　[C] appreciaction

　　[D] skepticism

　

　**Text 3**

　　Up until a few decades ago, our visions of the future were largely - though by no means uniformly - glowingly positive. Science and technology would cure all the ills of humanity, leading to lives of fulfillment and opportunity for all.

　　Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper appreciation of the range of threats facing us, from asteroid strike to epidemic flu and to climate change. You might even be tempted to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.

　　But such gloominess is misplaced. The fossil record shows that many species have endured for millions of years - so why shouldn't we? Take a broader look at our species' place in the universe, and it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of surviving for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years . Look up Homo sapiens in the "Red List" of threatened species of the International Union for the Conversation of Nature (IUCN) ,and you will read: "Listed as Least Concern as the species is very widely distributed, adaptable, currently increasing, and there are no major threats resulting in an overall population decline."

　　So what does our deep future hold? A growing number of researchers and organisations are now thinking seriously about that question. For example, the Long Now Foundation has its flagship project a medical clock that is designed to still be marking time thousands of years hence .

　　Perhaps willfully , it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about the more immediate future. The potential evolution of today's technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly complicated, and it's perhaps best left to science fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That's one reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the near future.

　　But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can say with considerable assurance. As so often, the past holds the key to the future: we have now identified enough of the long-term patterns shaping the history of the planet, and our species, to make evidence-based forecasts about the situations in which our descendants will find themselves.

This long perspective makes the pessimistic view of our prospects seem more likely to be a passing fad. To be sure, the future is not all rosy. But we are now knowledgeable enough to reduce many of the risks that threatened the existence of earlier humans, and to improve the lot of those to come.

　　31. Our vision of the future used to be inspired by

　　[A] our desire for lives of fulfillment

　　[B] our faith in science and technology

　　[C] our awareness of potential risks

　　[D] our belief in equal opportunity

　　32. The IUCN’s “Red List” suggest that human being are

　　[A] a sustained species

　　[B] a threaten to the environment

　　[C] the world’s dominant power

　　[D] a misplaced race

　　33. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 5?

　　[A] Arc helps limit the scope of futurological studies.

　　[B] Technology offers solutions to social problem.

　　[C] The interest in science fiction is on the rise.

　　[D] Our Immediate future is hard to conceive.

　　34. To ensure the future of mankind, it is crucial to

　　[A] explore our planet’s abundant resources

　　[B] adopt an optimistic view of the world

　　[C] draw on our experience from the past

　　[D] curb our ambition to reshape history

　　35. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

　　[A] Uncertainty about Our Future

　　[B] Evolution of the Human Species

　　[C] The Ever-bright Prospects of Mankind

　**Text 4**

　　On a five to three vote, the Supreme Court knocked out much of Arizona’s immigration law Monday-a modest policy victory for the Obama Administration. But on the more important matter of the Constitution,the decision was an 8-0 defeat for the Administration’s effort to upset the balance of power between the federal government and the states.

　　In Arizona v. United States, the majority overturned three of the four contested provisions of Arizona’s controversial plan to have state and local police enforce federal immigration law. The Constitutional principles that Washington alone has the power to “establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization ”and that federal laws precede state laws are noncontroversial . Arizona had attempted to fashion state policies that ran parallel to the existing federal ones.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the Court’s liberals, ruled that the state flew too close to the federal sun. On the overturned provisions the majority held the congress had deliberately “occupied the field” and Arizona had thus intruded on the federal’s privileged powers.

　　However,the Justices said that Arizona police would be allowed to verify the legal status of people who come in contact with law enforcement.That’s because Congress has always envisioned joint federal-state immigration enforcement and explicitly encourages state officers to share information and cooperate with federal colleagues.

　　Two of the three objecting Justice-Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas-agreed with this Constitutional logic but disagreed about which Arizona rules conflicted with the federal statute.The only major objection came from Justice Antonin Scalia,who offered an even more robust defense of state privileges going back to the alien and Sedition Acts.

　　The 8-0 objection to President Obama turns on what Justice Samuel Alito describes in his objection as “a shocking assertion assertion of federal executive power”.The White House argued that Arizona’s laws conflicted with its enforcement priorities,even if state laws complied with federal statutes to the letter.In effect, the White House claimed that it could invalidate any otherwise legitimate state law that it disagrees with .

　　Some powers do belong exclusively to the federal government, and control of citizenship and the borders is among them. But if Congress wanted to prevent states from using their own resources to check immigration status, it could. It never did so. The administration was in essence asserting that because it didn’t want to carry out Congress’s immigration wishes, no state should be allowed to do so either. Every Justice rightly rejected this remarkable claim.

　　36. Three provisions of Arizona’s plan were overturned because they

　　[A] deprived the federal police of Constitutional powers.

　　[B] disturbed the power balance between different states.

　　[C] overstepped the authority of federal immigration law.

　　[D] contradicted both the federal and state policies.

　　37. On which of the following did the Justices agree,according to Paragraph4?

　　[A] Federal officers’ duty to withhold immigrants’information.

[B] States’ independence from federal immigration law.

　　[C] States’ legitimate role in immigration enforcement.

　　[D] Congress’s intervention in immigration enforcement.

　　38. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that the Alien and Sedition Acts

　　[A] violated the Constitution.

　　[B] undermined the states’ interests.

　　[C] supported the federal statute.

　　[D] stood in favor of the states.

　　39. The White House claims that its power of enforcement

　　[A] outweighs that held by the states.

　　[B] is dependent on the states’ support.

　　[C] is established by federal statutes.

　　[D] rarely goes against state laws.

　　40. What can be learned from the last paragraph?

　　[A] Immigration issues are usually decided by Congress.

　　[B] Justices intended to check the power of the Administrstion.

　　[C] Justices wanted to strengthen its coordination with Congress.

　　[D] The Administration is dominant over immigration issues.

　　The social sciences are flourishing.As of 2005,there were almost half a million professional social scientists from all fields in the world, working both inside and outside academia. According to the World Social Science Report 2010,the number of social-science students worldwide has swollen by about 11% every year since 2000.

　　Yet this enormous resource in not contributing enough to today’s global challenges including climate change, security,sustainable development and health.(41)______Humanity has the necessary agro-technological tools to eradicate hunger , from genetically engineered crops to arificial fertilizers . Here , too, the problems are social: the organization and distribution of food, wealth and prosperity.

　　(42)____This is a shame—the community should be grasping the opportunity to raise its influence in the real world. To paraphrase the great social scientist Joseph Schumpeter:there is no radical innovation without creative destruction .

Today ,the social sciences are largely focused on disciplinary problems and internal scholarly debates,rather than on topics with external impact.

　　Analyses reveal that the number of papers including the keywords “environmental changed” or “climate change” have increased rapidly since 2004,(43)____

　　When social scientists do tackle practical issues ,their scope is often local:Belgium is interested mainly in the effects of poverty on Belgium for example .And whether the community’s work contributes much to an overall accumulation of knowledge is doubtful.

　　The problem is not necessarily the amount of available funding (44)____this is an adequate amount so long as it is aimed in the right direction. Social scientists who complain about a lack of funding should not expect more in today’s economic climate.

　　The trick is to direct these funds better.The European Union Framework funding programs have long had a category specifically targeted at social scientists.This year,it was proposed that system be changed:Horizon 2020,a new program to be enacted in 2014,would not have such a category ,This has resulted in protests from social scientists.But the intention is not to neglect social science ; rather ,the complete opposite.(45)____That should create more collaborative endeavors and help to develop projects aimed directly at solving global problems.

　　[A] It could be that we are evolving two communities of social

　　scientists:one that is discipline-oriented and publishing in highly

　　specialized journals,and one that is problem-oriented and publishing

　　elsewhere,such as policy briefs.

　　[B] However,the numbers are still small:in 2010,about 1,600 of the

　　100,000 social-sciences papers published globally included one of these

　　Keywords.

　　[C] the idea is to force social to integrate their work with other categories, including health and demographic change food security, marine research and the bio-economy, clear, efficient energy; and inclusive, innovative and secure societies.

　　[D] the solution is to change the mindset of the academic community, and what it considers to be its main goal. Global challenges and social innovation ought to receive much more attention from scientists, especially the young ones.

　　[E] These issues all have root causes in human behavior . all require behavioral change and social innovations , as well as technological development . Stemming climate change , for example , is as much about changing consumption patterns and promoting tax acceptance as it is about developing clean energy.

[F] Despite these factors , many social scientists seem reluctant to tackle such problems . And in Europe , some are up in arms over a proposal to drop a specific funding category for social-science research and to integrate it within cross-cutting topics of sustainable development .

　　[G] During the late 1990s , national spending on social sciences and the humanities as a percentage of all research and development funds-including government, higher education, non-profit and corporate -varied from around 4% to 25%; in most European nations , it is about 15%.

　　It is speculated that gardens arise from a basic need in the individuals who made them: the need for creative expression. There is no doubt that gardens evidence an impossible urge to create, express, fashion, and beautify and that self-expression is a basic human urge; (46) Yet when one looks at the photographs of the garden created by the homeless, it strikes one that , for all their diversity of styles, these gardens speak os various other fundamental urges, beyond that of decoration and creative expression.

　　One of these urges had to do with creating a state of peace in the midst of turbulence, a “still point of the turning world,” to borrow a phrase from T. S. Eliot. (47)A sacred place of peace, however crude it may be, is a distinctly human need, as opposed to shelter, which is a distinctly animal need. This distinction is so much so that where the latter is lacking, as it is for these unlikely gardens, the foemer becomes all the more urgent. Composure is a state of mind made possible by the structuring of one’s relation to one’s environment. (48) The gardens of the homeless which are in effect homeless gardens introduce from into an urban environment where it either didn’t exist or was not discernible as such. In so doing they give composure to a segment of the inarticulate environment in which they take their stand.

　　Another urge or need that these gardens appear to respond to, or to arise from is so intrinsic that we are barely ever conscious of its abiding claims on us. When we are deprived of green, of plants, of trees, (49)most of us give into a demoralization of spirit which we usually blame on some psychological conditions, until one day we find ourselves in garden and feel the expression vanish as if by magic. In most of the homeless gardens of New York City the actual cultivation of plants is unfeasible, yet even so the compositions often seem to represent attempts to call arrangement of materials, an institution of colors, small pool of water, and a frequent presence of petals or leaves as well as of stuffed animals. On display here are various fantasy elements whose reference, at some basic level, seems to be the natural world. (50)It is this implicit or explicit reference to nature that fully justifies the use of word garden though in a “liberated” sense, to describe these synthetic constructions. In them we can see biophilia- a yearning for contact with nonhuman life-assuming uncanny representational forms.

　　   【解析】 根据上下文的逻辑关系判断，在提出一个观点之后，接下来就是进行例证。选项中只有[A] 表示“例如”，符合这一逻辑关系，故选[A]。[B]表示“平均”的意思;[C]为“大体上，原则上”;[D] 为“首先”，均不符合。

　　5. 【答案】 [B]

　　   【考点分析】 上下文语义和词汇辨析

　　   【解析】 这四个选项均可以与介词 of 搭配，[A] 表示“喜欢”， [B] 表示“害怕，恐怕”， [C] 表示“能够，具有…能力”， [D] 表示“轻率的，考虑不周的”。of 后面的短语作 judge 的定语，这句话意思是“XXX地显得对犯罪太过软弱的法官可能更倾向于给被告作出判刑的判决”。根据上下文的意思，可以排除 [A] 和 [D]。而“显得对犯罪太过软弱”显然不是某种能力，故可以排除[C] 选项。根据上下文意思，害怕显得过于软弱的法官，才会更倾向于作出较严厉的判决。故选[B]。

　　6. 【答案】 [B]

　　   【考点分析】 介词搭配

　　   【解析】 soft on sb/sth 是一个固定搭配词组，表示“对某人/某事态度偏软，不够严厉”的意思，故选[B]。

　　7.【答案】A

　　  【考点分析】 逻辑衔接题

　　  【解析】 前半句含义是“一个担心自己会犯罪行为上表现的过分软弱的法官可能会判人入狱”，后半句含义是“当天他已经判五到六个人缓刑”两句间的逻辑关系明显为假设。A if 表示假设“如果”。B until “直到。。。才。。。”。C though “然而”，表转折。D unless “除非”，表让步。前半句是结果主句，后半句是一个假设条件，所以选C

8.【答案】 D。

【考点分析】 上下文语义及动词辨析

　　  【解析】 本句话是说要进行试验来验证观点。空格后的名词idea作宾语，对决定动词十分关键。

　　动词意思应为“测试”。A promote “促进”。B emphasize “强调”。C share “分享”。D test “测试”。只有D 选项和“观点”搭配，符合语境。

9.【答案】 D。

【考点分析】 上下文语义及名词辨析

　　  【解析】 本句话含义是讲其中一个申请者与其他申请在面试中的关系。申请者希望成功。A decisioin “选择”。B quality “质量”。C status “身份”。D success “成功”。只有D 项搭配，符合语境。

10.【答案】 A。

【考点分析】 后置定语

　　   【解析】 本句意为测试中随机选出的其他申请者。A chosen “选出”。B stupid “笨的”。C found “发现”。D identified “识别”。只有A 选项和申请者搭配意为选出来的申请者，符合语境。

11.【答案】 D。

【考点分析】 逻辑衔接题

　　   【解析】 后半句开头的but已经暗示了下文的连接词。内容上前半句意为一个申请者的面试成功和其他申请者没有关系，后半句意为西蒙森怀疑事实。明显是转折关系。A exceptional “例外的”。B defensible “可防御的”。C replaceable “可替换的”。D otherwise “相反的”。只有D项可以表转折关系，所以选D。

\12. 【答案】 C。

【考点分析】 后置定语

　　    【解析】 本句前半句是说西蒙森研究了面试者的结果，后半句含义是招生办官员。所以这里应该是招生办官员举行面试，后半句做后置定语。A inspire “鼓舞”。B expressed “表达”。C conducted “举行”。D secured “保护”。所以结合上下文可以得出只有C项符合语境。

　　13.【答案】B

　　   【考点分析】 上下文语义及动词词义辨析

　　   【解析】 文中句子含义为，“面试官有13个申请者一到五级打分”A .assign 分配;指派; 将财产过户(尤指过户给债权人)B .rate 认为;估价，C.match 使比赛D .arrange 安排，根据上下文含义，应选B.

　　14.【答案】 [D]

　　   【解析】固定搭配。 题干This scale 14 numerous factors into consideration. 空格处需要动词一个。因为后面有into consideration. 所以选took. Take into consideration 是把什么考虑在内的意思。

　　15. 【答案】 [B]

　　   【解析】本题考查逻辑关系，通过上下文应该选择一个表顺承先后顺序的词，只有B项then合适。

　　16. 【答案】 [C]

　　    【考点分析】 上下文语义和逻辑关系

　　    【解析】 这句话 which 引导一个定语从句，修饰 exam，考试都有一个总分，这句话的意思是说“以800分计算的标准测试”，可以排除[A]、[B]和 [D]选项。mark 表示“得分”，符合原文意思，故选[C]。

　　17. 【答案】 [A]

【考点分析】 上下文语义和逻辑关系

　　    【解析】 根据词语的意思和搭配，可以排除 [C] 和 [D] 选项。这题的选择必须与后面一题联系起来进行选择，这句话说“前面候选者的分数比XXX的候选者高0.75分”，则“下一个候选者则XXX”，由此可知，“前面的候选者”肯定不能是比他后面的人分数高，排除[B]。[A] 选项符合上下文逻辑关系，故选[A]。

\18. 【答案】C. 

【解析】根据上下文意思，是一种up和down 的趋势，17空前面是up趋势，所以18谓语动词应该选“下降”的趋势的动词，A,B,C,D之中明显的表下降的是B项， drop相对于前面的high。

\19. 【答案】B. 

【解析】根据上下文应该选一个“消除”影响的含义的动词，答案当中B项和A,C相反，B是“消除”即“不会产生”，符合上下文。

\20. 【答案】C

【解析】 本题需要找个形容词修饰points, A 项promising “有前途的，有希望的”;意思不合适，很明显B,C,D当中C项necessary符合上下文。

　　

**Section** **Ⅱ Reading Comprehension**

**Part A**

**Text 1**

21.【答案】B insensitivity to fashion.

【解析】事实细节题。根据题干，首先定位到首段。由文章第一句后半句“…scolds her unattractive assistant for imagining that high fashion doesn’t affect her.”意思是：“……批评她没有魅力的助理，因为助理认为高级时尚对她的生活影响不大”。可知criticize是对scolds的同义替换，B项中的“insensitivity to fashion”是“imagining that high fashion doesn’t affect her.”的同义替换。所以B项为正确答案。A项在文中并未提及，属于无中生有。C项和D项是对文章第一句的曲解。

22.【答案】D shop for their garments more frequently.

【解析】事实细节题。根据题干，首先定位到第二段。由倒数第二句“these labels encourage style-conscious consumers to see clothes as disposable, ……, and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks.”意思是“这些商标(畅销商标)促使有时尚意识的消费者将服装看成是用完就可以丢弃的，……，并且每周更新他们的衣橱。”D选项 “shop for their garments more frequently”的意思是“更加频繁地购买服装”，正好是“renew their wardrobe every few weeks”的同义替换。A，B，C项均属于无中生有项。

23.【答案】A accusation.

【解析】词义题。题干中需要猜测词义的单词出现在第二段的第一句“……the feverish world described in Overdressed, Elizabeth Cline’s three-year indictment of ‘fast fashion’”。再结合选项可知，“indictment”是Elizabeth Cline对“快时尚”的一种态度。因此，解答此题的关键在于联系上下文语境，找到Elizabeth Cline对“快时尚”的态度。由第二段最后一句“By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking an industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.”，意思是“Cline说，通过以特别低的价格销售潮流物品，这些品牌破坏了潮流周期，动摇了这个长久以来习惯于季节周期的产业”。由“hijack”和“shaking”可知，Cline对“快时尚”应该是持否定态度的，所以选项A“accusation (谴责)”是正确选项。

24.【答案】D pricing is vital to environmental-friendly purchasing.

【解析】推理判断题。根据题干，可定位到最后一段。解题关键在于“Vanity is a constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can’t afford not to”，意思是“每个人都很虚荣，这很常见。但消费者付不起太多东西的时候，他们才会以更加可持续的方式去购物。”这句的关键词是“afford”和“shop more sustainably”，对应于D项中的“pricing”和“environmental-friendly purchasing”。A项对于本段的曲解。B项说的是“忽视环境的可持续发展”，与文中“several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on labor and the environment…”(一些时尚服饰公司已经做出努力减少对劳动力和环境)意思相悖。C项文中未提及。

25.【答案】C criticism of the fast-fashion industry.

【解析】主旨大意题。此题考查对全文主旨大意的准确归纳。从整个文章脉络来看，文章的第一段用事例引入，第二段讲到文章的主题“快时尚”，并指出它破坏了时尚周期，动摇了时尚产业。第三四段指出“快时尚”这种变革的弊端，比如：给自然资源造成压力、使用大量有害的化学物质、浪费现象。最后两段提到针对“快时尚”的不良影响，可以采取的解决办法。由此可知，C项统领全文，为正确答案。A, B,D项都不是文章所论述的中心主题。

 

**Text 2**

\26. 【答案】B lower their operational costs

【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力。此类题目的解题关键在于根据题干信息定位，本题的“Paragraph 1”，“behavioural”即为定位信息。

根据文章第一段第二句“this fraction can be much reduced”在互联网时代，至少在理论上，被浪费的那一部分资金中，有很多都可以节省下来。对应文章“half of all advertising budgets are wasted”。故B项“降低运营成本”是文章的同义改写。ABD项文章均为提到。

\27. 【答案】D internet browser developers 

【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力。根据题干中已经给出了具体信息点“The industry”应回第三段定位。

　　根据题干信息“the industry”可推测the为前文指代，所以应当定位到该句之前，文章内容为：“摩斯拉(Mozilla)的火狐(Firefox)、微软(Microsoft)的IE(Internet Explorer)及苹果的浏览器Safari都有“不允许跟踪”选项;今年，谷歌也将在Chrome中加入这一功能”，由此可推断出选项D“网络浏览器开发商”为正确选项。

\28. 【答案】C will not benefit consumers

【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力。结合题干中所给出的人名“Bob Liodice”以及专有名词DNT和“default”可回文章定位到第五段。

　  文章中Bob Liodice称，“如果广告商不能收集有关用户偏好的信息，那么这对于消费者来说将更为不利。”原文中“consumers will be worse off”对应C选项“will not benefit consumers”，“将对消费者不利”，因此C应为正确答案。A项与原文相反，“垃圾广告”不是减少而是增加。B项“对广告业没有影响”以及D项“违背人性”均与文章不符。

\29. 【答案】A  DNT may not serve its intended purpose

【解析】此题考查考生对文章的细节信息的把握能力，关键在于定位和辨别细节信息。

　　 根据题干信息提示，我们不难定位到文章第六段最后一句的后半部分“…some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.” 一些公司可能忽略“不允许跟踪”信号，继续记录用户的在线行为。所以推知"不允许跟踪"可能不会起到预期的作用。选项B广告商很乐意实行“不允许跟踪”与本段第一句话“It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. 广告商们会对此作何反应仍不清楚”不符。选项C"不允许跟踪"已经不再收到消费者的欢迎与本段第一句和最后一句内容“…some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.” 不符;选项C广告商被迫提供"行为"广告与文中“Getting a DNT signal does not oblige anyone to stop tracking…”不相符。

\30. 【答案】D skepticism

【解析】此题考查考生对作者观点态度的把握。根据自然段定位法可定位到文章的最后一段。

　  根据关键信息Brendon Lynch我们主要定位到文章最后一段的倒数第二句以及最后一句。Brendon Lynch“在博客中写道：‘我们认为用户应该有更大的话语权。’”紧接着最后一句“Could it really be that simple? 真的是这么简单吗?”体现了作者的态度。A项意为“纵容”;B项为““理解”之义;选项C为“感激”之义;D项为“怀疑”。因此只有D项符合作者本意，故为正确答案。

**Text 3**

\31. 【答案】 B our faith in science and technology

【解析】细节题。根据题干信息，our vision of the future used to定位为文章第一段。B选项为答案，我们的对未来的想象曾经被我们对于科技的信心所鼓舞。 A 选项错误原因为因果倒置，lives of fulfillment是由science and technololgy导致，与文章题干要求our vision of future 无关。C选项为无中生有，也未提到awareness of potential risks的概念。D选项equal opportunity为opportunity for all所有人都有相等的机会的曲解。

\32. 【答案】B a threaten to the environment

【解析】推理题。文章问题是“Red List”表明人类怎么是什么。根据关键词定位到文章的第三段。Look up Homo sapiens in the "Red List" of threatened species of the International Union for the Conversation of Nature (IUCN) ,and you will read….根据threatened species知道是被威胁的物种，同时后面的the Conversation of Nature知道是对自然的。那这个“threatened”被人类威胁就很明显。

\33. 【答案】 D Our Immediate future is hard to conceive.

【解析】判断题。 A 选项定位在it's perhaps best left to science fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That's one reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the near future.这里根本就没有讲限制。这2句话是说要让科幻小说的作者和未来学家去探索我们能现象的可能性。.这里发表的Arc根本就没有讲限制。A 排除B讲科技，但是文章说完The potential evolution of today's technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly complicated,讲科技和它的社会意义。后面一句 and it's perhaps best…能看得到转折。文章也没有提到solution，也没有提到社会问题(social problem).

　　C 选项是说对科幻小说的兴趣在上升(on the rise)但是整段都没有说到这个趋势。D选项定位文章第一句话　Perhaps willfully , it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about the more immediate future.从这句话能推测出immediate future是比漫长的时标更难的事情，也是更不易察觉的。

\34. 【答案】 C draw on our experience from the past

【解析】细节题。 定位的是future of the mankind ,文章第6段，同时有个很重要的标点符号冒号，说明the past holds the key to the future: 一直在点号之前都是这句话的具体解释。也就是说这句强调the past 的关键性，所以选择C。A项B项和D项都跟内容无关。

\35. 【答案】A Uncertainty about Our Future

【解析】主旨题 文章最好的题目是A选项，对未来的不确定性。文章第一段讲过去人们对于未来的想象，第二，三段为对现在的看法。第四段至最后一段为对未来的不确定性。B选项为人类的演化，C选项为人类美好的前景，D选项科学，技术与人类不是文章的主旨 。顾答案为A。

　　

**Text 4**

\36. 【答案】C

【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力

　  根据题干中的关键词 three provisions of Arizona定位到文中第二段。第一句提到Arizona计划的三个部分被推翻是让州和地方警察实施联邦移民法律。这句话没有相对应选项，所以看到后面一句，意思是宪法的规则是毋庸置疑的，它认为华盛顿本身就有建立一个统一的自然化的规则的权力，而且认为联邦法律优先于州法律。所以被推翻就是因为它超越了联邦移民法的权威。此题也可在第三段第二句话，因为它提到on the overturned provision, 意思是大部分人认为议会故意占据了领地，Arizona因此侵犯了联邦的享有特权的权力。所以，答案是B

\37. 【答案】C

【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力

　  根据题干的关键词the Justice 和Paragraph 4, 就可以准确定位在第四段。因为是判断正误题，我们就可以采用排除的方法。通过观察选项，发现B.C都是围绕State, 我们就可以先找关于它的内容。第四段第二句话提到，议会通常想象联邦和州一起实施移民法律，而且明确鼓励州和联邦的官员共享信息以及合作。所以C选项，即州在移民实施方面的合法的作用，是正确答案。

\38. 【答案】D

【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的推理引申能力

　　根据题干中的关键词Paragraph 5和the Alien and Sedition, 就可以精确定位在第五段第二句话的最后，也就是回归到the Alien and Sedition法案的州特权，所以和法案有关联的就是选项D. 而且我们也不难发现，B和D是一对矛盾选项，通过阅读文章，排除D.

\39. 【答案】A

【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力

　　根据题干中的关键词the White House, 定位在第六段。最后一句提到白宫声称它能够使任何它不同意的州法律不合法，也就是选项A.

\40. 【答案】D

【解析】此题考查考生对文章主旨的把握能力

　　根据前三段得出文章的主旨和移民法律有关，只有A和D提到，答案在其中之一。而A是说通常被议会决定，和本段第三段句话内容冲突。所以答案是D.

　　

**Part B**

文章来源于Luk Van Langenhon在《自然》杂志中关于对社会科学研究的资金未来取向，他的论据从社会科学的投资收益率角度，建议我们应该资助解决在各学科大环境下的大问题的研究。

\41. 【答案】E

【考点分析】 复现结构+代词纸带关系定位

【解析】此题为段中空，因此此空所填内容是由其上下文决定的。上句中Yet this enormous resource 没有对如今的global challenges做出足够的贡献，这些global challenges 包括 climate change, security, sustainable development and health. E选项中These issues指代上句中的各种global challenges，并且all have root causes in human behavior解释了为什么说this enormous resource in not contributing enough to today’s global challenges。因此E 选项为正确答案。

\42. 【答案】F

【考点分析】上下文逻辑关系定位

【解析】此题为段首空，其内容由下一句决定。空后说This is a shame，那么此句之前，即空中所填的内容一定是一个让人感觉 shameful的事情。只有F 选项中many social scientists seem reluctant to tackle such problems 是应该羞愧的事情。因此可以确定F 选项为正确答案

\43. 【答案】B

【考点分析】复现结构定位

【解析】此题为段尾空，其内容由上句确定。上一句句子主要意思是包括关键词environmental changed 和 climate change 的论文的数量迅速增长.，根据段落内容一致性原则，下面应该继续讲此类论文的数量问题。只有选项B 中继续说，“然而，这些数量还是很小的”，从内容上来说衔接十分紧密，因此B 为正确答案。

\44. 【答案】G

【考点分析】代词指代关系定位

【解析】此题为段中空，其内容由其上下句决定。空后面句子说this is an adequate amount，这是一个充足的数字。那么空中一定要出现的是一些数字，而选项中提到数字的只有B 和G 选项。B 选择数字之前直接说明the numbers are still small，数字仍然很小，与空后面说充足的数量矛盾，故排除。G 选项national spending …varied from around 4% to 25%, 符合空中所要求的内容，故为正确答案。

\45. 【答案】C

【考点分析】复现结构定位+代词指代关系定位

【解析】此题为段中空，其内容由其上下句确定。空后面有个代词that 并且说明That should create more collaborative endeavors 那将带来一个“合作性的”endeavors. C选项中the idea is to force social to integrate 也就是整合 their work with other categories。Integrate 与collaborative 同义复现，故为正确答案。

　　

**Section III Translation**

 

　　46.【句子分析】本句的主干为：it strikes one，其中it为形式主语，真正的主语为that引导的主语从句。句首是when 引导的时间状语从句。Beyond后的that指代的是上文的diversity。For all在句中是“尽管”的意思。

　　【译文】然而当人们观看那些由无家可归的人创建的花园的照片时，人们能会深深的震撼。因为这些花园不仅风格各异，在它的装饰和创造性之外，也透露出了其他的基本的人类需求。

　　47.【句子分析】本句的主干为：A sacred place of peace...is a distinctly human need.主谓之间插入了一个however引导的让步状语从句。as opposed to shelter后为which引导的非限制性定语从句，修饰shelter。In effect是“事实上，本质上”的意思。

　　【译文】尽管神圣的和平之地是原始的，但是它明显是一种人类本能的需求，和庇护所相反，那只是动物的本能需求。

　　48.【句子分析】本句的主干为：The gardens of the homeless...introduce form...where引导的是修饰environment的定语从句，在句子中作地点状语。

　　【译文】无家可归的人的花园，事实上是无家可归的花园。 它把一种形式引入城市环境中。在这些城市环境中要么没有这些花园，要么没有如此显眼的花园。

　　49.【句子分析】本句的主干为：most of us give into a demoralization of spirit...which紧跟spirit之后引导的是定语从句。Until引导的是时间状语从句，其中as if是“好像，正如”的意思。

　　【译文】 我们当中大多数人都屈服于精神上的败坏，我们经常把这种精神上的败坏推卸到心理环境上，直到有一天我们发现自己处于一个花园当中，并感受到这种精神的败坏不可思议的消失了。

　　50.【句子分析】本句是it is...that...形式的强调句型。强调的部分是主语this implicit or explicit reference to nature。主句的谓语动词是justifies。In a...sense是“在某种意义上，从某种意义上”的意思。

　　【译文】正是这种隐含或外露的对自热的提及充分证明了从一种“解放”的意义上说使用“花园”这个词来描述人工建筑是合理的。

　　Decisions after Graduation

　　Recently, there has been a growing concern among the public over the topic of the choice after graduation. As is described in the picture, a group of graduates is facing various roads such as: searching for jobs, pursuing further study, going abroad and entrepreneurship. The picture intends to convey to us this message: As adults, college students have to make decisions about their future life.

　　After graduation, college students have to make decisions about their future life. For those who are eager to become economically independent and to put into practice what they have learned in college, taking a job or doing poineering work will be both satisfying and rewarding. Getting established as a bread-winner after graduation is their main desire. By contrast, those who want to take advantage of the favorable conditions in college, however, will try to enroll in graduate programs inside or outside. For them, a Master's degree or even a Doctoral degree represents a much more ambitious goal than a bachelor's degree. In the same way, their lifetime success and interest lies more in academic achievements than in making money.

As far as I am concerned, it is sensible that we should take a rational attitude towards the decisive choice. For the part of my own, getting a higher degree abroad has long been my dream. This is based on my belief that I should do more research and learn more while I am still young. 

2013年考研英语 (一)大作文再次考察图画作文，这种题型广大考生应该不会陌生。图形中描述的是毕业生面临的不同选择，属于意义分析型中的人生哲理类文章，这也是跨考写作课程(写作课件P85-100)重点强调并且要求学生多次练习的类型，并且在考前跨考出版的《考研英语命题人考前8天作文大预测》P116，准确预测了“选择”这一话题。历年真题2004，2007，2008都属于意义分析型文章，其中2004年-终点又是新起点与2013年作文题目最为接近。

　　人生哲理型文章的第一段与其它类型的文章区别不大，描述图片以及点题，例如用As is revealed in the picture/ cartoon, … … 句型描写一下图片，第二句可以用句子The picture is fairly thought-provoking, which intends to convey to us this message: …点出主题。

　　第二段第一句揭示图片的象征寓意作为主题句，We can easily recognize the significance of … in terms of …。第二、三句可以从正反两方面论述主题On the one hand, … Take … as an example. … On the other hand … Without …, …(后果) 。

　　第三段总结段，总说你对图片中提到的人生哲理的观点进行概括。可选择的句型如：Considering all the points discussed above, it is advisable that we highly value … and apply it in our studies and work. … 或者：We are, therefore, supposed to take a rational attitude. …

 

 

# **2012****年全国硕士研究生入学统一考试英语试题**

## Section I Use of English

  **Directions:**

  Read the following text. Choose the best word(s) for each numbered blank and mark A, B, C or D on ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)

  The ethical judgments of the Supreme Court justices have become an important issue recently. The court cannot _1_ its legitimacy as guardian of the rule of law _2_ justices behave like politicians. Yet, in several instances, justices acted in ways that _3_ the court’s reputation for being independent and impartial.

  Justice Antonin Scalia, for example, appeared at political events. That kind of activity makes it less likely that the court’s decisions will be _4_ as impartial judgments. Part of the problem is that the justices are not _5_by an ethics code. At the very least, the court should make itself _6_to the code of conduct that _7_to the rest of the federal judiciary.

  This and other similar cases _8_the question of whether there is still a _9_between the court and politics.

  The framers of the Constitution envisioned law _10_having authority apart from politics. They gave justices permanent positions _11_they would be free to _12_ those in power and have no need to _13_ political support. Our legal system was designed to set law apart from politics precisely because they are so closely _14_.

  Constitutional law is political because it results from choices rooted in fundamental social _15_ like liberty and property. When the court deals with social policy decisions, the law it _16_ is inescapably political-which is why decisions split along ideological lines are so easily _17_ as unjust.

  The justices must _18_ doubts about the court’s legitimacy by making themselves _19_ to the code of conduct. That would make rulings more likely to be seen as separate from politics and, _20_, convincing as law.

##  Section II Reading Comprehension

###  Part A

 Directions:

 Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1. (40 points)

 **Text 1**

 Come on –Everybody’s doing it. That whispered message, half invitation and half forcing, is what most of us think of when we hear the words peer pressure. It usually leads to no good-drinking, drugs and casual sex. But in her new book Join the Club, Tina Rosenberg contends that peer pressure can also be a positive force through what she calls the social cure, in which organizations and officials use the power of group dynamics to help individuals improve their lives and possibly the word.

 Rosenberg, the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, offers a host of example of the social cure in action: In South Carolina, a state-sponsored antismoking program called Rage Against the Haze sets out to make cigarettes uncool. In South Africa, an HIV-prevention initiative known as LoveLife recruits young people to promote safe sex among their peers.

 The idea seems promising，and Rosenberg is a perceptive observer. Her critique of the lameness of many pubic-health campaigns is spot-on: they fail to mobilize peer pressure for healthy habits, and they demonstrate a seriously flawed understanding of psychology.” Dare to be different, please don’t smoke!” pleads one billboard campaign aimed at reducing smoking among teenagers-teenagers, who desire nothing more than fitting in. Rosenberg argues convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure.

 But on the general effectiveness of the social cure, Rosenberg is less persuasive. Join the Club is filled with too much irrelevant detail and not enough exploration of the social and biological factors that make peer pressure so powerful. The most glaring flaw of the social cure as it’s presented here is that it doesn’t work very well for very long. Rage Against the Haze failed once state funding was cut. Evidence that the LoveLife program produces lasting changes is limited and mixed.

 There’s no doubt that our peer groups exert enormous influence on our behavior. An emerging body of research shows that positive health habits-as well as negative ones-spread through networks of friends via social communication. This is a subtle form of peer pressure: we unconsciously imitate the behavior we see every day.

  Far less certain, however, is how successfully experts and bureaucrats can select our peer groups and steer their activities in virtuous directions. It’s like the teacher who breaks up the troublemakers in the back row by pairing them with better-behaved classmates. The tactic never really works. And that’s the problem with a social cure engineered from the outside: in the real world, as in school, we insist on choosing our own friends.

  \21. According to the first paragraph, peer pressure often emerges as

  [A] a supplement to the social cure

  [B] a stimulus to group dynamics

  [C] an obstacle to school progress

  [D] a cause of undesirable behaviors

  \22. Rosenberg holds that public advocates should

  [A] recruit professional advertisers

  [B] learn from advertisers’ experience

  [C] stay away from commercial advertisers

  [D] recognize the limitations of advertisements

  \23. In the author’s view, Rosenberg’s book fails to

  [A] adequately probe social and biological factors

  [B] effectively evade the flaws of the social cure

  [C] illustrate the functions of state funding

  [D]produce a long-lasting social effect

  \24. Paragraph 5shows that our imitation of behaviors

  [A] is harmful to our networks of friends

  [B] will mislead behavioral studies

  [C] occurs without our realizing it

  [D] can produce negative health habits

  \25. The author suggests in the last paragraph that the effect of peer pressure is

  [A] harmful

  [B] desirable

  [C] profound

  [D] questionable
  **Text 2**

  A deal is a deal-except, apparently ,when Entergy is involved. The company, a major energy supplier in New England, provoked justified outrage in Vermont last week when it announced it was reneging on a longstanding commitment to abide by the strict nuclear regulations.

  Instead, the company has done precisely what it had long promised it would not challenge the constitutionality of Vermont’s rules in the federal court, as part of a desperate effort to keep its Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant running. It’s a stunning move.

  The conflict has been surfacing since 2002, when the corporation bought Vermont’s only nuclear power plant, an aging reactor in Vernon. As a condition of receiving state approval for the sale, the company agreed to seek permission from state regulators to operate past 2012. In 2006, the state went a step further, requiring that any extension of the plant’s license be subject to Vermont legislature’s approval. Then, too, the company went along.

  Either Entergy never really intended to live by those commitments, or it simply didn’t foresee what would happen next. A string of accidents, including the partial collapse of a cooling tower in 207 and the discovery of an underground pipe system leakage, raised serious questions about both Vermont Yankee’s safety and Entergy’s management– especially after the company made misleading statements about the pipe. Enraged by Entergy’s behavior, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 last year against allowing an extension.

  Now the company is suddenly claiming that the 2002 agreement is invalid because of the 2006 legislation, and that only the federal government has regulatory power over nuclear issues. The legal issues in the case are obscure: whereas the Supreme Court has ruled that states do have some regulatory authority over nuclear power, legal scholars say that Vermont case will offer a precedent-setting test of how far those powers extend. Certainly, there are valid concerns about the patchwork regulations that could result if every state sets its own rules. But had Entergy kept its word, that debate would be beside the point.

  The company seems to have concluded that its reputation in Vermont is already so damaged that it has noting left to lose by going to war with the state. But there should be consequences. Permission to run a nuclear plant is a poblic trust. Entergy runs 11 other reactors in the United States, including Pilgrim Nuclear station in Plymouth. Pledging to run Pilgrim safely, the company has applied for federal permission to keep it open for another 20 years. But as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviews the company’s application, it should keep it mind what promises from Entergy are worth.

  \26. The phrase “reneging on”(Line 3.para.1) is closest in meaning to

  [A] condemning.

  [B] reaffirming.

  [C] dishonoring.

  [D] securing.

  \27. By entering into the 2002 agreement, Entergy intended to

  [A] obtain protection from Vermont regulators.

  [B] seek favor from the federal legislature.

  [C] acquire an extension of its business license .

  [D] get permission to purchase a power plant.

  \28. According to Paragraph 4, Entergy seems to have problems with its

  [A] managerial practices.

  [B] technical innovativeness.

  [C] financial goals.

  [D] business vision

  \29. In the author’s view, the Vermont case will test

  [A] Entergy’s capacity to fulfill all its promises.

  [B] the mature of states’ patchwork regulations.

  [C] the federal authority over nuclear issues .

  [D] the limits of states’ power over nuclear issues.

  \30. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that

  [A] Entergy’s business elsewhere might be affected.

  [B] the authority of the NRC will be defied.

  [C] Entergy will withdraw its Plymouth application.

  [D] Vermont’s reputation might be damaged.

**Text 3**

  In the idealized version of how science is done, facts about the world are waiting to be observed and collected by objective researchers who use the scientific method to carry out their work. But in the everyday practice of science, discovery frequently follows an ambiguous and complicated route. We aim to be objective, but we cannot escape the context of our unique life experience. Prior knowledge and interest influence what we experience, what we think our experiences mean, and the subsequent actions we take. Opportunities for misinterpretation, error, and self-deception abound.

  Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. Similar to newly staked mining claims, they are full of potential. But it takes collective scrutiny and acceptance to transform a discovery claim into a mature discovery. This is the credibility process, through which the individual researcher’s me, here, now becomes the community’s anyone, anywhere, anytime. Objective knowledge is the goal, not the starting point.

  Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives intellectual credit. But, unlike with mining claims, the community takes control of what happens next. Within the complex social structure of the scientific community, researchers make discoveries; editors and reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; other scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and finally, the public (including other scientists) receives the new discovery and possibly accompanying technology. As a discovery claim works it through the community, the interaction and confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology involved transforms an individual’s discovery claim into the community’s credible discovery.

  Two paradoxes exist throughout this credibility process. First, scientific work tends to focus on some aspect of prevailing Knowledge that is viewed as incomplete or incorrect. Little reward accompanies duplication and confirmation of what is already known and believed. The goal is new-search, not re-search. Not surprisingly, newly published discovery claims and credible discoveries that appear to be important and convincing will always be open to challenge and potential modification or refutation by future researchers. Second, novelty itself frequently provokes disbelief. Nobel Laureate and physiologist Albert Azent-Gyorgyi once described discovery as “seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought.” But thinking what nobody else has thought and telling others what they have missed may not change their views. Sometimes years are required for truly novel discovery claims to be accepted and appreciated.

  In the end, credibility “happens” to a discovery claim – a process that corresponds to what philosopher Annette Baier has described as the commons of the mind. “We reason together, challenge, revise, and complete each other’s reasoning and each other’s conceptions of reason.”

  \31. According to the first paragraph, the process of discovery is characterized by its

  [A] uncertainty and complexity.

  [B] misconception and deceptiveness.

  [C] logicality and objectivity.

  [D] systematicness and regularity.

  \32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that credibility process requires

  [A] strict inspection.

  [B]shared efforts.

  [C] individual wisdom.

  [D]persistent innovation.

  33.Paragraph 3 shows that a discovery claim becomes credible after it

  [A] has attracted the attention of the general public.

  [B]has been examined by the scientific community.

  [C] has received recognition from editors and reviewers.

  [D]has been frequently quoted by peer scientists.

  \34. Albert Szent-Györgyi would most likely agree that

  [A] scientific claims will survive challenges.

  [B]discoveries today inspire future research.

  [C] efforts to make discoveries are justified.

  [D]scientific work calls for a critical mind.

  35.Which of the following would be the best title of the test?

  [A] Novelty as an Engine of Scientific Development.

  [B]Collective Scrutiny in Scientific Discovery.

  [C] Evolution of Credibility in Doing Science.

  [D]Challenge to Credibility at the Gate to Science.

 **Text 4**

  If the trade unionist Jimmy Hoffa were alive today, he would probably represent civil servant. When Hoffa’s Teamsters were in their prime in 1960, only one in ten American government workers belonged to a union; now 36% do. In 2009 the number of unionists in America’s public sector passed that of their fellow members in the private sector. In Britain, more than half of public-sector workers but only about 15% of private-sector ones are unionized.

  There are three reasons for the public-sector unions’ thriving. First, they can shut things down without suffering much in the way of consequences. Second, they are mostly bright and well-educated. A quarter of America’s public-sector workers have a university degree. Third, they now dominate left-of-centre politics. Some of their ties go back a long way. Britain’s Labor Party, as its name implies, has long been associated with trade unionism. Its current leader, Ed Miliband, owes his position to votes from public-sector unions.

  At the state level their influence can be even more fearsome. Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California points out that much of the state’s budget is patrolled by unions. The teachers’ unions keep an eye on schools, the CCPOA on prisons and a variety of labor groups on health care.

  In many rich countries average wages in the state sector are higher than in the private one. But the real gains come in benefits and work practices. Politicians have repeatedly “backloaded” public-sector pay deals, keeping the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially pensions that are already generous.

  Reform has been vigorously opposed, perhaps most egregiously in education, where charter schools, academies and merit pay all faced drawn-out battles. Even though there is plenty of evidence that the quality of the teachers is the most important variable, teachers’ unions have fought against getting rid of bad ones and promoting good ones.

  As the cost to everyone else has become clearer, politicians have begun to clamp down. In Wisconsin the unions have rallied thousands of supporters against Scott Walker, the hardline Republican governor. But many within the public sector suffer under the current system, too.

  John Donahue at Harvard’s Kennedy School points out that the norms of culture in Western civil services suit those who want to stay put but is bad for high achievers. The only American public-sector workers who earn well above $250,000 a year are university sports coaches and the president of the United States. Bankers’ fat pay packets have attracted much criticism, but a public-sector system that does not reward high achievers may be a much bigger problem for America.

  \36. It can be learned from the first paragraph that

  [A] Teamsters still have a large body of members.

  [B] Jimmy Hoffa used to work as a civil servant.

  [C] unions have enlarged their public-sector membership.

  [D]the government has improved its relationship with unionists.

  \37. Which of the following is true of Paragraph 2?

  [A] Public-sector unions are prudent in taking actions.

  [B] Education is required for public-sector union membership.

  [C] Labor Party has long been fighting against public-sector unions.

  [D]Public-sector unions seldom get in trouble for their actions.

  \38. It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that the income in the state sector is

  [A] illegally secured.

  [B] indirectly augmented.

  [C] excessively increased.

  [D]fairly adjusted.

  \39. The example of the unions in Wisconsin shows that unions

  [A]often run against the current political system.

  [B]can change people’s political attitudes.

  [C]may be a barrier to public-sector reforms.

  [D]are dominant in the government.

  \40. John Donahue’s attitude towards the public-sector system is one of

  [A]disapproval.

  [B]appreciation.

  [C]tolerance.

  [D]indifference.

### Part B

  **Directions:**

  In the following text, some sentences have been removed. For Questions 41-45, choose the most suitable one from the list A-G to fit into each of the numbered blanks. There are two extra choices, which do not fit in any of the blanks. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET1.(10 points)

  Think of those fleeting moments when you look out of an aeroplane window and realise that you are flying, higher than a bird. Now think of your laptop, thinner than a brown-paper envelope, or your cellphone in the palm of your hand. Take a moment or two to wonder at those marvels. You are the lucky inheritor of a dream come true.

  The second half of the 20th century saw a collection of geniuses, warriors, entrepreneurs and visionaries labour to create a fabulous machine that could function as a typewriter and printing press, studio and theatre, paintbrush and gallery, piano and radio, the mail as well as the mail carrier. (41)

  The networked computer is an amazing device, the first media machine that serves as the mode of production, means of distribution, site of reception, and place of praise and critique. The computer is the 21st century's culture machine.

  But for all the reasons there are to celebrate the computer, we must also tread with caution. (42)I call it a secret war for two reasons. First, most people do not realise that there are strong commercial agendas at work to keep them in passive consumption mode. Second, the majority of people who use networked computers to upload are not even aware of the significance of what they are doing.

  All animals download, but only a few upload. Beavers build dams and birds make nests. Yet for the most part, the animal kingdom moves through the world downloading. Humans are unique in their capacity to not only make tools but then turn around and use them to create superfluous material goods - paintings, sculpture and architecture - and superfluous experiences - music, literature, religion and philosophy. (43)

  For all the possibilities of our new culture machines, most people are still stuck in download mode. Even after the advent of widespread social media, a pyramid of production remains, with a small number of people uploading material, a slightly larger group commenting on or modifying that content, and a huge percentage remaining content to just consume. (44)

  Television is a one-way tap flowing into our homes. The hardest task that television asks of anyone is to turn the power off after he has turned it on.

  (45)

  What counts as meaningful uploading? My definition revolves around the concept of "stickiness" - creations and experiences to which others adhere.

  [A] Of course, it is precisely these superfluous things that define human culture and ultimately what it is to be human. Downloading and consuming culture requires great skills, but failing to move beyond downloading is to strip oneself of a defining constituent of humanity.

  [B] Applications like tumblr.com, which allow users to combine pictures, words and other media in creative ways and then share them, have the potential to add stickiness by amusing, entertaining and enlightening others.

  [C] Not only did they develop such a device but by the turn of the millennium they had also managed to embed it in a worldwide system accessed by billions of people every day.

  [D] This is because the networked computer has sparked a secret war between downloading and uploading - between passive consumption and active creation - whose outcome will shape our collective future in ways we can only begin to imagine.

  [E] The challenge the computer mounts to television thus bears little similarity to one format being replaced by another in the manner of record players being replaced by CD players.

  [F] One reason for the persistence of this pyramid of production is that for the past half-century, much of the world's media culture has been defined by a single medium - television - and television is defined by downloading.

  [G]The networked computer offers the first chance in 50 years to reverse the flow, to encourage thoughtful downloading and, even more importantly, meaningful uploading.

**Part C**

**Directions:**

  Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points)

  Since the days of Aristotle, a search for universal principles has characterized the scientific enterprise. In some ways, this quest for commonalities defines science. Newton’s laws of motion and Darwinian evolution each bind a host of different phenomena into a single explicatory frame work.

  (**46)**In physics, one approach takes this impulse for unification to its extreme, and seeks a theory of everything—a single generative equation for all we see.It is becoming less clear, however, that such a theory would be a simplification, given the dimensions and universes that it might entail, nonetheless, unification of sorts remains a major goal.

  This tendency in the natural sciences has long been evident in the social sciences too. (**47)**Here, Darwinism seems to offer justification for it all humans share common origins it seems reasonable to suppose that cultural diversity could also be traced to more constrained beginnings. Just as the bewildering variety of human courtship rituals might all be considered forms of sexual selection, perhaps the world’s languages, music, social and religious customs and even history are governed by universal features. (**48)**To filter out what is unique from what is shared might enable us to understand how complex cultural behavior arose and what guides it in evolutionary or cognitive terms.

  That, at least, is the hope. But a comparative study of linguistic traits published online today supplies a reality check. Russell Gray at the University of Auckland and his colleagues consider the evolution of grammars in the light of two previous attempts to find universality in language.

  The most famous of these efforts was initiated by Noam Chomsky, who suggested that humans are born with an innate language—acquisition capacity that dictates a universal grammar. A few generative rules are then sufficient to unfold the entire fundamental structure of a language, which is why children can learn it so quickly.

  **(49)**The second, by Joshua Greenberg, takes a more empirical approach to universality identifying traits (particularly in word order) shared by many language which are considered to represent biases that result from cognitive constraints

  Gray and his colleagues have put them to the test by examining four family trees that between them represent more than 2,000 languages.(**50)**Chomsky’s grammar should show patterns of language change that are independent of the family tree or the pathway tracked through it. Whereas Greenbergian universality predicts strong co-dependencies between particular types of word-order relations. Neither of these patterns is borne out by the analysis, suggesting that the structures of the languages are lire age-specific and not governed by universals

# **2012****考研英语真题答案****解析**

**Section** **Ⅰ** **Use of English**

  

  1．【答案】[B]

　　【解析】此空有赖于对后文的理解。这直接体现了我们作完型的整体思路，也就是首先通读全文。尤其是看到最后一段直接给出提议：希望法官和政治划清界限从而保证自己的权威性，因此全文的导向和逻辑就非常清晰了。同时，题2答案(when)也顺势而出：如果法官们和政治家一样，法庭就不能捍卫自己作为法律卫道士的权威。

  \2. 【答案】[A]

　　 【解析】这里的when其实表示条件关系，即“如果……。”

  \3. 【答案】[B]

　　 【解析】选择 weakened。上下文语义题+词义辨析。选项含义差别较大，要求对上下文逻辑关系掌握清楚。Yet表示一个转折：“即使这样，还是有很多法官这样做，损害了法庭独立和公正的名声。” 本题如果能把导向把握准，即可定位在B和D两项，D项eliminated 过于绝对，排除。

  \4. 【答案】[D]

　　 【解析】上下文语义。依然是通过上下文逻辑关系，按段精度解题。这段用两个法官参与政治事件的例子说明他们的行为使得法院的裁决不偏不倚而被认可变得不太可能。A选项challenged 和C项suspected意义相反，和主旨矛盾，即肯定了法官参与政治行为。B项compromised “调停” 和主题无关。

  \5. 【答案】[C]

　　 【解析】上下文语义题。本段属于总分形式。首先提出法官参与政治导致的问题，然后分析问题的原因：“这种情况有一部分是由于法官们不受伦理道德准则的约束。” 其他三项不合逻辑，均不具干扰性。

  \6. 【答案】[B]

　　 【解析】完型填空在历史上对于subject这个词一向情有独钟。04年，05年，08年以及10年选项中都出现，只有05年落选。而且这3年考查的意思都一致，即“易遭受……”，考查形式有“is subjected to”， “is subject to” 以及 “subject sb. to sth。(使得某人容易遭受)”。今年依然是“subject”入选，但是这次取了大家最熟悉的意思，即“使服从，受…管制”，“法院应该依行为准则办事”。至于选项A resistant 和 C immune两个选项和subject 这三个词在04年的第8道题也同时出现。“Be immune to”指“对…免疫，不起作用”。可见很多时候命题人不总以内容为基础来设置干扰选项，也提醒大家要重视对于历年真题的复习。

  \7. 【答案】[D]

　　 【解析】上下文语义题。选项所在的句子是定语从句，修饰前面的“code of conduct”， 即“法院应该让自己服从于那些也同样应用于其他联邦法院的行为准则”。A项resort to：诉诸于，求助于; B项sticks to: 坚持;这两项的主语都不能是“code”，属搭配不当。C项lead to，导致。意义不符，直接排除。

  \8. 【答案】[B]

　　 【解析】上下文语义+固定搭配。“raise the question of” 提出了……的问题。这一句是承上启下段。全文的导向是“法官法庭应该和政治分离开来”，然后引出负面例子，紧接着就引出了这句话：“这些案件提出了问题：究竟法庭和政治之间是否还存在界限。” 言下之意，法官和法庭和政治总是撇不清关系，符合全文导向。A. evade “规避，逃避” 和D项“处理，解决”，不符合上下文逻辑。 C项“否决”和后面的 “question whether…” 构不成搭配。

  \9. 【答案】[A]

　 　【解析】上下文语义+固定搭配。“a line between…”：“在…存在或划清界限”。

  10.【答案】[B]

　   【解析】介词用法。envision…as… 把……预想成为…

  11.【答案】[A]

　　 【解析】逻辑关系词。前后句明显是因果关系，so 引导一个结果状语从句。

  12.【答案】[C]

　　 【解析】上下文语义题。“法官被赋予永恒地位，因而可以不用顾忌惩戒那些有权力的人。”其他三个选项均不符合上下文逻辑。

  13.【答案】[C]

　　 【解析】上下文语义题。“有了这种地位做保障，也就不需要再去花心思培养发展政治支持。”

  14【答案】[D]

【解析】上下文语义题。“法制系统旨在将政治与法律相分隔，因为它们彼此联系太紧。”其他三项完全构不成干扰。

  15.【答案】[A]

　　 【解析】词义辨析题。“liberty”和“property”同属社会基本理念，而不是 theories (理论) 或divisions (分支)。D项conception 常指具体的或个人的理念而非笼统意义的理念。

  16.【答案】[C]

　　 【解析】考查熟词僻义。“Shape a plan”， 作出计划。本词所在的句子为省略了that 的定语从句。“当法院处理社会政策决议的问题时，它们制定出来的法律将不可避免的政治化。”

  17.【答案】[A]

　　【解析】考查熟词僻义。Dismiss 在这里意为“拒绝考虑，遭拒”。“这就解释了为什么不同意识形态导致的决议分歧总是被认为不公正因而不予考虑。

  18.【答案】[C]

　　 【解析】依然考查熟词僻义。最后一段提出建议。希望法官们必须处理人们对于法庭合法性的质疑。“address” 一词作为“处理，解决”的意思在完型中不是第一次出现。06年的完型中最后一段“address the needs of the homeless”， 解决无家可归者的需求。只不过当年这里并没有设空。其他三项均不符合逻辑。

  19【答案】[D]

　　【解析】考查点：同义复现+熟词僻义。此题和第二段的题6构成同义复现。“be accountable to…”不是“可解释的”，而是指“有义务，对…负责”。“be agreeable to” 是“愉快的;同意的”;虽然也有“适合的，符合品位的”的意思，但题中to后面接的是code，不合逻辑。 “agreeable to everybody: 适合于所有人”。A项 “be accessible to…,可接近…，能得到的” 和B项“amiable” 和蔼可亲的，与主题无关。

  20.【答案】[D]

　　 【解析】考查逻辑关系词。A项 by all means 和B 项at all costs 用法一致，切含义相近，首先排除。C项in a word 是“总之”，总结全文下结论时用，而且多用在句首。这里and连接词前面的内容是“让法律法规和政治分离开来”，后面的内容是“更能服人”，显然两者是因果关系。

  

**Section** **Ⅱ** **Reading Comprehension**

  **Part A**

  **Text 1**

  21.【答案】[D] a cause of undesirable behaviors一些不良行为的原因

　　 【解析】细节题：选项：a cause of undesirable behaviors对应文中It usually leads to no good-drinking, drugs and casual sex。题干中的often对应原文中的usually;选项中undesirable behaviors对应no good-drinking, drugs and casual sex. lead与cause。同义替换，难度不大。

  22.【答案】[B] learn from advertisers’ experience从广告人那里学习经验

　　 【解析】细节题，首先根据题干中的关键词public advocates 和should 定位到：三段最后一句：Rosenberg argues convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure。分别对应句中的public-health advocates和ought to， 从四个选项中课看出来正确选项可能和advertiser或者advertisement有关，从而把目光锁定在take a page from advertisers，但是很多同学都不知道它是什么意思，但是这可从后文的，so skilled at applying，(也能熟练的运用)，再对照四个选项不难选出正确答案B，学习才能运用啊。

  23.【答案】[A] adequately probe social and biological factors 足够的探究社会和生物因素

　　 【解析】考查作者的观点;从题干中可看出，题目问的是Rosenberg’s book不能(怎么样)也就是问他的不足，通过book对应第四段第二句的斜体为书名，对应题干中的book, 指出不足;后面一句中的主语Join the Club 为此人所写，所以后面的表述就是他的观点：not enough exploration of the social and biological factors that make peer pressure so powerful.： exploration对probe，同义替换，not enough exploration也和fails to adequately对应。这个题难度也不大，能明确定位，找到对应的句子，答案中的probe 可能是引起考试不敢选择A答案的关键，在09年第三篇的的第四题中，当时很多同学选择错误答案B答案是因为B选项中除了prior这个单词不认识外，其他的刚好的文中定位处的同义替换，而很多同学都达成这样一个共识：和文章中某句话相似度很高的选项不会是正确选项，选项A与第四段第二句话相似度很高。基于这两方面的原因，不认识probe这个词的考生就不敢选择A答案了。

  24.【答案】[C] occurs without our realizing it 在没有意识到的时候就出现了

　　  【解析】细节题;通过题干中imitation和behaviors可定位于第五段最后一句。This is a subtle form of peer pressure: we unconsciously imitate the behavior we see every day。对 unconsciously，subtle这个词在我们04年第二篇文章的第二题的答案中出现过，04年第二篇文章关于社会中按字母排序现象的这篇文章时应该有印象，我们的27题的答案选择的是D答案：Some form of discrimination is to subtle to recognize,大家可以看一下这道题和以前考过的题出现的相似性。

  25.【答案】[D] questionable 值得怀疑的

　　 【解析】态度题 考查作者对同龄人压力效果的态度，对应Far less certain, however, is…，第一句中in virtuous(正直的，有效的)directions。 但是大家不认识也不会影响句子的理解，因为紧接着第二句在举例， 就像那些老师为了将后排捣乱的学生分开而将他们和他们与表现好的学生安排在一块， The tactic never really works…(这些策略(方法)不是真正起作用的)表明作者认为同龄人压力效果是不确定的。

 

**Text 2**

  2012年考研英语阅读Text2的文章来源于Boston.com上的一篇评论性文章，题为Vermont Yankee plant’s owner must honor its own promises. 文章的题材属于信息科技类文章。讲述的是有关New England 一家公司购买了核电站后，不遵守核能源的一些相关规定后所引起的一些争议。就文章本身而言，放置在Reading的第二篇，难度不能算大。因为行文中，专业性术语和词汇不多，基本不影响考生对文章总体的理解。但是本篇文章中出现了一些相对比较生僻的词汇，如：renege on, aging reaction 等，但是通过上下文的揣摩和推测，要判断出这些生词的意思应该比较容易。所以整体而言，Text2的难度系数中等。题材合理。依旧是开篇直接引出问题所在。所以第一段应该是大家应该多加留心和关注的焦点。也有助于大家理解全文，把握文章的中心大意。

  26.【答案】C

　　 【解析】  语义题。考的是一个词汇在文章中的特定含义。Reneging on 出现在文章中的第一段。我们 先从选项入手。A. condemning 谴责 B. reaffirming 重申，再肯定 C. dishonoring 拒付，丢脸，不光彩 D. securing 保卫，保护 从文中我们可以看到，公司的这种行为激起了公愤，是在当它…一个长期以来坚持遵守的承诺，有关遵守严格的核能源惯例。根据常识可以判断：此处一定是一个贬义词，所以才导致引起了群众的愤怒，并且需要和commitment构成动宾关系，所以综合考虑，可以先排除A和D选项。而B选项“重申”，是一个中性词，所以本句话的意思是：这个公司违反了惯例。正确选项为：C

  27.【答案】A

　　 【解析】事实细节题。“加入2002年的协议，Entergy本打算，，”需要把信息定位到文章第3段，第四行，“…the company agreed to seek permission from state regulators to operate past 2012.”公司同意2012年以后的运营需要在征得州相关管理规定的允许为前提条件。可以判断出：正确选项为A。即：打算得到来自Vermont 的管理规定的保护。应该是与原文属于同义替换。B选项错在 “Federal”一词上，扩大了范围。C选项的意思是：延长商业执照的有效期，误解了原文意思。D选项提到获得购买一个电厂的许可与原文中“已经购买了唯一的一个核电站”的描述不符，所以排除。

  28.【答案】A

　　 【解析】 推断性实施细节题。文章第四段在讲：公司出现的另外一些如管道泄露等等问题也给公司造成了一定的影响。所以可以判断出，不仅仅是它违背核能源惯例这一项使得它进入了当下的困境中。而是公司本身内部也存在一系列的问题。纵观选项：A。管理实践 B。技术创新

  C. 财务目标 D. 商业前景 那么属于公司的问题，并且是内部的，最终选项为A 管理实践方面出现的问题。和财务，前景以及技术方面都没有直接的关联。

  29.【答案】B

　　 【解析】 事实细节题。作者认为Vermont 案例能检验出，，， 我们可以把信息定位到文章第5段第4-5行：”…legal scholars say that Vermont case will offer a precedent-setting test of how far these powers extend…” 我们可以得到是一种对权力的检测，检测各个州所拥有的这种权利到底能延伸多远。所以对象应该是针对州，而不是公司。首先排除A 和C. 余下的B选项和D选项当中，B的意思是各州这些比较杂乱的制度的成熟程度，而D选项指的是在核问题上，各州权力的局限性。结合文章，我们最终选择B选项，因为文章更多的是在指各州如何来运用自己的权利，而非强调局限性。

  30.【答案】B

　　 【解析】推断题。提到一个关键词：NRC 需要定位到文章最后一个段落。文章最后一句提到：But as the NRC reviews the company’s application, it should keep it mind what from Entergy are worth。” 用排除法，可以先排除选项D 名誉可能会损坏与原文不符，因为原文说道 is already damaged. 接下来，从文章中可以看到公司提出的申请是有关年限延长的申请而非能不能在Plymouth 的申请，所以可以排除选项C. 而A选项中提到公司在其他地方的生意会受到影响恰恰与文章描述相反。所以，综上所述，正确 选项为B 也就是说这一系列的事件已经对NRC 的权威构成了一种挑战。

  

**Text 3**

​    本文摘自The Scientist(《科学家》)2011年2月1日刊出的题为“The Evolution of Credibility”的文章。文章围绕“信度的演变”这一话题展开论述。科学是如何打造而成?在理想化的版本中，关于世界的事实有待客观的科研人员展开收集工作。但在实际的科研工作中，科学探索通常是不确定的复杂过程。每个人所固有的生活经验，知识和兴趣偏向影响科研的过程和结果。因此通常所说的研究成果，我们只能称之为前科学，即，处于假说或不完善阶段，有待验证的理论。如何才能让其完善成熟成为科学呢?首先需要接受来自相关领域知识界的验证。如，研究成果要发表，需过编辑和评论家那关;然后其他科研者可能会引用你的文章，可能会将其应用到科技上，也可能会出现新的研究成果。这个互动、共享、竞争的过程将单个的研究成果演变为公众的信度检测。

​    第四段描述信度演变过程存在的两个悖论。首先，科研工作者致力于研究不完善或错误的领域，他们极少对已经验证过的东西有兴趣。因此，新的研究成果会成为他们的聚焦目标，接受来自未来科研工作的不断挑战或否定。再者，新的研究成果本身就会引起质疑，你的研究成果即使是对的，也不一定能说服他人。有时候，一项正确的新的研究成果需要经过几年，几十年才能为大家所接受。最后，这项研究成果终于具备了信度。

  31.【答案】A

　　 【解析】答案在文章第一段第四行，ambiguous and complicated 与 选项A. uncertainty and complexity同义词转换，为正确选项。

  32.【答案】B

　　 【解析】第二段第三句 it takes collective scrutiny and acceptance to …选项B表达了相同意思，为同义句。再者，第二段为承上启下段，后面的第三段对这个观点进行了详细论述。

  33.【答案】B

　　 【解析】此为段落概括的考察，A是无关选项，文中没有提到;选项C，D为干扰项，只是文中所说的一个方面，以小概念偷换大概念，此为考研英语干扰项常见模式。

  34.【答案】D

　　 【解析】此题较难，很容易选错。首先，选项A，B可以排除，因为A，B是第一个悖论的观点，Albert的话属于第二个悖论。英语文章具有很强的逻辑性，且非常清晰，标点符号是最好的识别标志。另外，根据句子意思，选项C与段落关联不大，因此D为最佳答案。

  35.【答案】C

　　 【解析】此题为全文主旨题，较为容易。

 

**Text 4**

  这是出自经济学人杂志2011年3月11号的一篇文章，题为：

  Enemies of progress ：The biggest barrier to public- sector reform are the unions

  36.【答案】C

　　 【解析】解析：段落推理题 优先对应主题和转折;但是都没有，只能逐个排除：

  [A] Teamsters still have a large body of members. Teamsters依然有大量的会员

  文中没有提及

  [B] Jimmy Hoffa used to work as a civil servant. Jimmy Hoffa曾经是一名公务员

  he would probably represent civil servant他可能会代表公务员，并不意味着他是公务员。

  [C] unions have enlarged their public-sector membership。工会已经增加了其公共行业的会员

  only one in ten American government workers belonged to a union; now 36% do。

  现在有36%确实增加了。正解!

  [D]the government has improved its relationship with unionists。

  政府已经提升了其同工会会员之间的关系。

  没有提及政府和工会会员之间的关系排除。

  37.【答案】A

　　 【解析】细节题中的which 题，只能一个个排除：

  先看[B] Education is required for public-sector union membership。

  公共行业的工会会员需要教育

  文中说到了Second, they are mostly bright and well-educated. A quarter of America’s public-sector workers have a university degree。但是并没有说需要教育。

  再看[C] Labor Party has long been fighting against public-sector unions。

  工党同公共行业的工会长期斗争

  Britain’s Labor Party, as its name implies, has long been associated with trade unionism。

  选项和原文间的表述是相反的。

  再看[D]Public-sector unions seldom get in trouble for their actions。

  公共行业的工会很少由于他们的行为而惹麻烦。

  First, they can shut things down without suffering much in the way of consequences。

  首先他们可以罢工而不遭受后果。

  同义替换成功。

  最后看[A] Public-sector unions are prudent in taking actions。

  公共行业的工会在采取行动是会更加谨慎

  这是一个很强烈的干扰项，但是文中并没有提到工会很谨慎，原文----选项A----选项B

  最后答案只能选A而不能选B;B 为未提及选项。

  38.【答案】B

　　 【解析】细节题 对应keeping the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially pensions that are already generous。保持收入小幅上涨，但是增加假期特别是已经很慷慨的补助了。

  主要是一个单词大家不认识augmented出题人开始耍无赖了，考研词汇大纲中并无此单词，不过根据另外一个副词是可以推出答案的。

  39.【答案】C

　　 【解析】例证题 找观点 Reform has been vigorously opposed;之后的例子就应该围绕改革来讲。

  40.【答案】A

　　 【解析】局部态度题，在转折的地方but a public-sector system that does not reward high achievers may be a much bigger problem for America出现bigger problem 表明了态度为disapproval。.

  

**Part B**

  41.【答案】C

　　 【解析】复现结构定位法+代词指代定位法

  41题出现在段尾。复现结构“The second half of the 20th century”20世纪后半期，与“the turn of the millennium”千年之交。代词 “such a device”指代“fabulous machine、typewriter and printing press”等设备。因此，正确答案为C。

  42.【答案】D

　　 【解析】复现结构定位法

42题出现在段中，根据就近原则，线索为“ a secret war”一场秘密的战争。正确答案为D。

  43.【答案】A

　　 【解析】逻辑关系定位法+复现结构定位法+代词指代定位法

  43题出现在文章段尾，前一句中提到superfluous material goods多余的材料，选项A中宾语these superfluous things这些多余的东西，可以在43题前一句中找到所指。前后两句话形成一个因果的逻辑关系，用连接词Of course ，因此正确答案为A。

  44.【答案】F

　　 【解析】代词指代定位法+复现结构定位法

  44题出现在段尾，起到承上启下的作用。第一个复现点在44题前一句主语a pyramid of production 在选项F中宾语this pyramid of production复现。第二个复现点在television 是下一段落的主语，所以F选项为正确答案。

  45.【答案】G

　　 【解析】复现结构定位法

  45题出现在段尾，起承上启下的作用。前文提到电视是one-way tap flowing单向流动，而互联网可以reverse the flow 逆转这个流动。the flow的所指one-way tap flowing单向流动。第二个复现结构在于启下，45题下一段为特殊疑问句，中心词为meaningful uploading有意义的上传，选项G提及meaningful uploading这一信息，所以，选项G为正确答案。

 

**Part C**

  本文选自2011年4月14日出版的《自然》杂志，为一篇人文社科类文章，涉及语言学方面。从词汇角度，涉及到一些考生难以把握的较具专业性的词语;从语法角度，题目主从句之间的关系也不是很复杂。主要考查了定语从句，宾语从句，形式主语，非谓语动词等。

  \46. 【解析】本题语法结构并不复杂，关键在于对于概念陌生的unification的正确把握。unification是动词unify的名词形式，意为“统一、一元化”。然而，结合上段最后一句：Newton's laws of motion and Darwinian evolution each bind a host of different phenomena into a single explicatory framework。以及本句并列结构后半部分，可以把握在本文中，意为：一致的解释理论。另外，本句最后还到对定语从句的考查：we see为all的定语从句。

  【参考译文】在物理学上，有一种方法把这种追求一致解释理论的愿望发挥到了极致，它试图找到一种万物的理论——用唯一的生成等式解释我们能看到的所有事物。

  47.【解析】本句语法结构并不复杂，for为连词，意为“因为”。后半句涉及到对于形式主语的考查。

  【参考译文】在此，达尔文主义似乎提供了一种合理解释，因为如果整个人类都有着相同的起源，那么认为，文化多样性也可能追溯到人类更有局限性的开端，似乎是有理由的。

  48.【解析】本句主语为不定式短语to filter out what is unique from what is shared，谓语部分为enable sb to do sth。其中考查了4个宾语从句，语法结构方面较上两句复杂。句中代词it指代complex cultural behavior;term一词，考生可联想短语in terms of(就…而言，在…方面)来选择恰当词义;filter out意为：“过滤掉、筛除、淘汰”。

  【参考译文】如果我们从共性之中去除个性，那么或许我们能够理解复杂的文化行为如何产生，以及何种因素在进化或认识的角度，引导了这种复杂的文化行为。

  49.【解析】本题考点涉及代词的还原，现在分词做状语，过去分词做后置定语，非限制性定语从句以及被动。句首the second，回上文寻找，可在上段第一句找到The most famous of these efforts was initiated by Noam Chomsky，其中initiate为“发起、创始”，可推知此处为the second effort，即上文的two previous attempts;shared by many language修饰traits;which引导的定语从句，同样修饰traits;定语从句的中的被动语态可采用主动的译法，添加主语“人们”。

  【参考译文】做出第二次努力的是乔舒亚·格林伯雷。他采用更加经验的方法来研究这种普遍性，他发现了多种语言的共同特征(特别是词序上的特征)，而人们认为这种共同特征体现了认识由于认知局限所产生的偏见。

  50.【解析】语法结构方面，本句考查了定语从句，过去分词做后置定语，并列结构等。词汇方面，family tree词义的选择，可借助上文by examining four family trees that between them represent more than 2,000 languages，可判断为语言的谱系，后文代词it指代family tree。

  【参考译文】乔姆斯基的语法应该表明语言变化的模式，这种模式独立于语言谱系，或者独立于由该谱系所产生的路径，而格林伯格的普遍性理论则认为在特定种类的词序关系之间，有着紧密的相互依赖关系。

  【详解】： 认真分析图画，两个人针对同一个掉在地上的酒瓶，作出完全了不同的反应。一个人看到的是那些洒在地上的酒，因此唉声叹气。另一个人看到的时候剩在酒瓶里的酒，因此觉得情况尚没有那么糟糕。从图中信息不难看出，出题者意图是反映面对困境时两类不同的人的不同态度。前者悲观因此眼中尽是悲剧，而后者乐观却总能看喜剧。因此可知，本文写作中心应该围绕不同的态度导致不同人生。写作过程中由于本文中心比较抽象，因此可以佐以例证。

 

  In recent years, there have been great concerns over the life attitude of the youngsters. As is depicted in the picture above, facing a bottle with most the wine spilled out on the ground, one man is sighing the tragedy, whereas the other rejoices over the remained wine in the bottle。

  The real implications of the picture lies in that different attitude leads to completely diverse results. For optimistic people, they could find the happiness even facing the most difficult situation. And life is a comedy. Conversely, for people with pessimistic attitude, troubles are everywhere and always exist. Their lives is filled with one after another tragedies。

  To my best understanding, the story of Den Yaping could be the best illustration of this point. If she kept upset by her stature, she could not have achieved so much in table tennis. All in all, young people should bear in mind that "better to light a candle than to curse the darkness"。

## Section II Reading Comprehension

### Part A

**Directions:**

Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing [A], [B], [C] or [D]. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1. (40 points)

**Text 1**

The decision of the New York Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbert as its next music director has been the talk of the classical-music world ever since the sudden announcement of his appointment in 2009. For the most part, the response has been favorable, to say the least. “Hooray! At last!” wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober-sided classical-music critic.

One of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, however, is that Gilbert is comparatively little known. Even Tommasini, who had advocated Gilbert’s appointment in the Times, calls him “an unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about him.” As a description of the next music director of an orchestra that has hitherto been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez, that seems likely to have struck at least some Times readers as faint praise.

For my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good one. To be sure, he performs an impressive variety of interesting compositions, but it is not necessary for me to visit Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear interesting orchestral music. All I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my computer and download still more recorded music from iTunes.

Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance are missing the point. For the time, attention, and money of the art-loving public, classical instrumentalists must compete not only with opera houses, dance troupes, theater companies, and museums, but also with the recorded performances of the great classical musicians of the 20th century. There recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances; moreover, they can be “consumed” at a time and place of the listener’s choosing. The widespread availability of such recordings has thus brought about a crisis in the institution of the traditional classical concert.

One possible response is for classical performers to program attractive new music that is not yet available on record. Gilbert’s own interest in new music has been widely noted: Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, has described him as a man who is capable of turning the Philharmonic into “a markedly different, more vibrant organization.” But what will be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra’s repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the relationship between America’s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hops to attract.

\21. We learn from Para.1 that Gilbert’s appointment has

[A]incurred criticism.    [B]raised suspicion.   [C]received acclaim.   [D]aroused curiosity.

\22. Tommasini regards Gilbert as an artist who is 

[A]influential.   [B]modest.   [C]respectable.   [D]talented.

\23. The author believes that the devoted concertgoers

[A]ignore the expenses of live performances.   [B]reject most kinds of recorded performances.

[C]exaggerate the variety of live performances. [D]overestimate the value of live performances.

\24. According to the text, which of the following is true of recordings?

[A]They are often inferior to live concerts in quality.

[B]They are easily accessible to the general public.

[C]They help improve the quality of music.    [D]They have only covered masterpieces.

\25. Regarding Gilbert’s role in revitalizing the Philharmonic, the author feels

[A]doubtful.  [B]enthusiastic.   [C]confident.  [D]puzzled.

 

**Text 2**

When Liam McGee departed as president of Bank of America in August, his explanation was surprisingly straight up. Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual vague excuses, he came right out and said he was leaving “to pursue my goal of running a company.” Broadcasting his ambition was “very much my decision,” McGee says. Within two weeks, he was talking for the first time with the board of Hartford Financial Services Group, which named him CEO and chairman on September 29.

McGee says leaving without a position lined up gave him time to reflect on what kind of company he wanted to run. It also sent a clear message to the outside world about his aspirations. And McGee isn’t alone. In recent weeks the No.2 executives at Avon and American Express quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post. As boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, executives who don’t get the nod also may wish to move on. A turbulent business environment also has senior managers cautious of letting vague pronouncements cloud their reputations. 

As the first signs of recovery begin to take hold, deputy chiefs may be more willing to make the jump without a net. In the third quarter, CEO turnover was down 23% from a year ago as nervous boards stuck with the leaders they had, according to Liberum Research. As the economy picks up, opportunities will abound for aspiring leaders.

The decision to quit a senior position to look for a better one is unconventional. For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive CEO candidates are the ones who must be poached. Says Korn/Ferry senior partner Dennis Carey:”I can’t think of a single search I’ve done where a board has not instructed me to look at sitting CEOs first.”

Those who jumped without a job haven’t always landed in top positions quickly. Ellen Marram quit as chief of Tropicana a decade age, saying she wanted to be a CEO. It was a year before she became head of a tiny Internet-based commodities exchange. Robert Willumstad left Citigroup in 2005 with ambitions to be a CEO. He finally took that post at a major financial institution three years later.

Many recruiters say the old disgrace is fading for top performers. The financial crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one. “The traditional rule was it’s safer to stay where you are, but that’s been fundamentally inverted,” says one headhunter. “The people who’ve been hurt the worst are those who’ve stayed too long.”

\26. When McGee announced his departure, his manner can best be described as being

[A]arrogant.  [B]frank.  [C]self-centered.  [D]impulsive.

\27. According to Paragraph 2, senior executives’ quitting may be spurred by

[A]their expectation of better financial status.  [B]their need to reflect on their private life.

[C]their strained relations with the boards.     [D]their pursuit of new career goals.

[A]approved of.  [B]attended to.  [C]hunted for.   [D]guarded against.

\29. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that

[A]top performers used to cling to their posts. [B]loyalty of top performers is getting out-dated.

[C]top performers care more about reputations. [D]it’s safer to stick to the traditional rules.

\30. Which of the following is the best title for the text?

[A]CEOs: Where to Go?                 [B]CEOs: All the Way Up?

The rough guide to marketing success used to be that you got what you paid for. No longer. While traditional “paid” media – such as television commercials and print advertisements – still play a major role, companies today can exploit many alternative forms of media. Consumers passionate about a product may create “owned” media by sending e-mail alerts about products and sales to customers registered with its Web site. The way consumers now approach the broad range of factors beyond conventional paid media.

Paid and owned media are controlled by marketers promoting their own products. For earned media , such marketers act as the initiator for users’ responses. But in some cases, one marketer’s owned media become another marketer’s paid media – for instance, when an e-commerce retailer sells ad space on its Web site. We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-commerce engines within that environment. This trend ,which we believe is still in its infancy, effectively began with retailers and travel providers such as airlines and hotels and will no doubt go further. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has created BabyCenter, a stand-alone media property that promotes complementary and even competitive products. Besides generating income, the presence of other marketers makes the site seem objective, gives companies opportunities to learn valuable information about the appeal of other companies’ marketing, and may help expand user traffic for all companies concerned.

The same dramatic technological changes that have provided marketers with more (and more diverse) communications choices have also increased the risk that passionate consumers will voice their opinions in quicker, more visible, and much more damaging ways. Such hijacked media are the opposite of earned media: an asset or campaign becomes hostage to consumers, other stakeholders, or activists who make negative allegations about a brand or product. Members of social networks, for instance, are learning that they can hijack media to apply pressure on the businesses that originally created them.

If that happens, passionate consumers would try to persuade others to boycott products, putting the reputation of the target company at risk. In such a case, the company’s response may not be sufficiently quick or thoughtful, and the learning curve has been steep. Toyota Motor, for example, alleviated some of the damage from its recall crisis earlier this year with a relatively quick and well-orchestrated social-media response campaign, which included efforts to engage with consumers directly on sites such as Twitter and the social-news site Digg.

31.Consumers may create “earned” media when they are 

[A] obscssed with online shopping at certain Web sites. 

[B] inspired by product-promoting e-mails sent to them. 

[C] eager to help their friends promote quality products.

[D] enthusiastic about recommending their favorite products. 

\32. According to Paragraph 2,sold media feature 

[A] a safe business environment.        [B] random competition. 

[C] strong user traffic.                 [D] flexibility in organization. 

\33. The author indicates in Paragraph 3 that earned media

[A] invite constant conflicts with passionate consumers. 

[B] can be used to produce negative effects in marketing. 

[C] may be responsible for fiercer competition.

**Text 4**

It’s no surprise that Jennifer Senior’s insightful, provocative magazine cover story, “I love My Children, I Hate My Life,” is arousing much chatter – nothing gets people talking like the suggestion that child rearing is anything less than a completely fulfilling, life-enriching experience. Rather than concluding that children make parents either happy or miserable, Senior suggests we need to redefine happiness: instead of thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-to-moment joy, we should consider being happy as a past-tense condition. Even though the day-to-day experience of raising kids can be soul-crushingly hard, Senior writes that “the very things that in the moment dampen our moods can later be sources of intense gratification and delight.”

The magazine cover showing an attractive mother holding a cute baby is hardly the only Madonna-and-child image on newsstands this week. There are also stories about newly adoptive – and newly single – mom Sandra Bullock, as well as the usual “Jennifer Aniston is pregnant” news. Practically every week features at least one celebrity mom, or mom-to-be, smiling on the newsstands.

In a society that so persistently celebrates procreation, is it any wonder that admitting you regret having children is equivalent to admitting you support kitten-killing ? It doesn’t seem quite fair, then, to compare the regrets of parents to the regrets of the children. Unhappy parents rarely are provoked to wonder if they shouldn’t have had kids, but unhappy childless folks are bothered with the message that children are the single most important thing in the world: obviously their misery must be a direct result of the gaping baby-size holes in their lives.

Of course, the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like Us Weekly and People present is hugely unrealistic, especially when the parents are single mothers like Bullock. According to several studies concluding that parents are less happy than childless couples, single parents are the least happy of all. No shock there, considering how much work it is to raise a kid without a partner to lean on; yet to hear Sandra and Britney tell it, raising a kid on their “own” (read: with round-the-clock help) is a piece of cake.

It’s hard to imagine that many people are dumb enough to want children just because Reese and Angelina make it look so glamorous: most adults understand that a baby is not a haircut. But it’s interesting to wonder if the images we see every week of stress-free, happiness-enhancing parenthood aren’t in some small, subconscious way contributing to our own dissatisfactions with the actual experience, in the same way that a small part of us hoped getting “ the Rachel” might make us look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston.

36.Jennifer Senior suggests in her article that raising a child can bring

[A]temporary delight                [B]enjoyment in progress

[C]happiness in retrospect            [D]lasting reward

37.We learn from Paragraph 2 that

[A]celebrity moms are a permanent source for gossip.

[B]single mothers with babies deserve greater attention.

[C]news about pregnant celebrities is entertaining.

[D]having children is highly valued by the public.

38.It is suggested in Paragraph 3 that childless folks

[A]are constantly exposed to criticism.         [B]are largely ignored by the media.

[C]fail to fulfill their social responsibilities.     [D]are less likely to be satisfied with their life.

39.According to Paragraph 4, the message conveyed by celebrity magazines is

[A]soothing   .[B]ambiguous.  [C]compensatory.  [D]misleading.

40.Which of the following can be inferred from the last paragraph?

[A]Having children contributes little to the glamour of celebrity moms.

[B]Celebrity moms have influenced our attitude towards child rearing.

[C]Having children intensifies our dissatisfaction with life.

[D]We sometimes neglect the happiness from child rearing.

**Directions:** 

The following paragraph are given in a wrong order. For Questions 41-45, you are required to reorganize these paragraphs into a coherent text by choosing from the list A-G to filling them into the numbered boxes. Paragraphs E and G have been correctly placed. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)

[A] No disciplines have seized on professionalism with as much enthusiasm as the humanities. You can, Mr Menand points out, became a lawyer in three years and a medical doctor in four. But the regular time it takes to get a doctoral degree in the humanities is nine years. Not surprisingly, up to half of all doctoral students in English drop out before getting their degrees.

[B] His concern is mainly with the humanities: Literature, languages, philosophy and so on. These are disciplines that are going out of style: 22% of American college graduates now major in business compared with only 2% in history and 4% in English. However, many leading American universities want their undergraduates to have a grounding in the basic canon of ideas that every educated person should posses. But most find it difficult to agree on what a “general education” should look like. At Harvard, Mr Menand notes, “the great books are read because they have been read”-they form a sort of social glue.

[C] Equally unsurprisingly, only about half end up with professorships for which they entered graduate school. There are simply too few posts. This is partly because universities continue to produce ever more PhDs. But fewer students want to study humanities subjects: English departments awarded more bachelor’s degrees in 1970-71 than they did 20 years later. Fewer students requires fewer teachers. So, at the end of a decade of theses-writing, many humanities students leave the profession to do something for which they have not been trained.

[D] One reason why it is hard to design and teach such courses is that they can cut across the insistence by top American universities that liberal-arts educations and professional education should be kept separate, taught in different schools. Many students experience both varieties. Although more than half of Harvard undergraduates end up in law, medicine or business, future doctors and lawyers must study a non-specialist liberal-arts degree before embarking on a professional qualification.

[E] Besides professionalizing the professions by this separation, top American universities have professionalised the professor. The growth in public money for academic research has speeded the process: federal research grants rose fourfold between 1960and 1990, but faculty teaching hours fell by half as research took its toll. Professionalism has turned the acquisition of a doctoral degree into a prerequisite for a successful academic career: as late as 1969a third of American professors did not possess one. But the key idea behind professionalisation, argues Mr Menand, is that “the knowledge and skills needed for a particular specialization are transmissible but not transferable.”So disciplines acquire a monopoly not just over the production of knowledge, but also over the production of the producers of knowledge.

[F] The key to reforming higher education, concludes Mr Menand, is to alter the way in which “the producers of knowledge are produced.”Otherwise, academics will continue to think dangerously alike, increasingly detached from the societies which they study, investigate and criticize.”Academic inquiry, at least in some fields, may need to become less exclusionary and more holistic.”Yet quite how that happens, Mr Menand dose not say.

[G] The subtle and intelligent little book The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University should be read by every student thinking of applying to take a doctoral degree. They may then decide to go elsewhere. For something curious has been happening in American Universities, and Louis Menand, a professor of English at Harvard University, captured it skillfully.

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written carefully on ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points)

With its theme that “Mind is the master weaver,” creating our inner character and outer circumstances, the book As a Man Thinking by James Allen is an in-depth exploration of the central idea of self-help writing.

(46) Allen’s contribution was to take an assumption we all share-that because we are not robots we therefore control our thoughts-and reveal its erroneous nature. Because most of us believe that mind is separate from matter, we think that thoughts can be hidden and made powerless; this allows us to think one way and act another. However, Allen believed that the unconscious mind generates as much action as the conscious mind, and (47) while we may be able to sustain the illusion of control through the conscious mind alone, in reality we are continually faced with a question: “Why cannot I make myself do this or achieve that? ”

Since desire and will are damaged by the presence of thoughts that do not accord with desire, Allen concluded : “ We do not attract what we want, but what we are.” Achievement happens because you as a person embody the external achievement; you don’t “ get” success but become it. There is no gap between mind and matter.

Part of the fame of Allen’s book is its contention that “Circumstances do not make a person, they reveal him.” (48) This seems a justification for neglect of those in need, and a rationalization of exploitation, of the superiority of those at the top and the inferiority of those at the bottom.

This ,however, would be a knee-jerk reaction to a subtle argument. Each set of circumstances, however bad, offers a unique opportunity for growth. If circumstances always determined the life and prospects of people, then humanity would never have progressed. In fat, (49)circumstances seem to be designed to bring out the best in us and if we feel that we have been “wronged” then we are unlikely to begin a conscious effort to escape from our situation .Nevertheless, as any biographer knows, a person’s early life and its conditions are often the greatest gift to an individual.

The sobering aspect of Allen’s book is that we have no one else to blame for our present condition except ourselves. (50) The upside is the possibilities contained in knowing that everything is up to us; where before we were experts in the array of limitations, now we become authorities of what is possible.

**Section II Reading Comprehension**

**Part A**

 

**Text 1**

21.【答案】[C] 
 　 【解析】推断题。本题要求根据文章第一段，判断社会对Gilbert的任命有什么回应和反响。根据原文第一段第二句“For the most part, the response has been favorable, …”和“Hooray! At last!”可知回应是积极的，因此正确答案是[C] received acclaim(得到称赞)。

　　干扰项：选项[A] incurred criticism (招致批评)，选项[B] raised suspicion(引起怀疑)， 选项[D] aroused curiosity(引起大众的好奇)，都不符合原文意思。

22.【答案】[B] 
 　 【解析】细节题。根据Tommasini在第二段对Gilbert的评论：calls him “ an unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about him”，可知Tommasini认为Gilbert是an unpretentious musician。unpretentious由un(否定前缀)和pretentious构成，考生看到pretentious可以想到pretend (假装，作假 )，那么可推出unpretentious是“不做假的，不虚饰或矫揉造作的”，答案[B] modest(谦逊的)意思最为接近，故[B]项为正确答案。

　　干扰项：文中提到，with no air of the formidable conductor about him，意思是“他没有指挥家那种强大的、令人敬畏的气势”，据此我们可以排除选项[A] influential(有影响力的)和选项[C] respectable (值得尊敬的)。选项[D] talented (有才华的)在文中也找不到依据，故排除。

23.【答案】[D] 
 　 【解析】推断题。本题考查作者对于现场表演的虔诚追随者的观点态度。从文章第三段可知，作者自己选择听唱片/录音而不是听现场音乐会。第四段开头作者提到，devoted concertgoers认为“录音不能代替现场表演”，但作者认为devoted concertgoers are missing the point(现场表演虔诚的追随者没有切中要害)，之后是论据支持作者的观点，作者认为These recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances，即录音便宜、容易得到，且通常比今天的现场音乐会有更高的艺术品质。[D]项overestimate the value of live performances(高估了现场表演的价值)是对作者对于devoted concertgoers观点的高度概括，故为正确答案。

　　干扰项：选项[A]意思是“喜欢听现场音乐会的人忽视了现场表演的花销”，原文确实提到These recordings are cheap，但是这个选项片面，没有概括性。选项[B]意思是“拒绝大多数种类演唱会录音”没有概括出作者对于devoted concertgoers的观点态度，太浅显，且与原文对devoted concertgoers的描述Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance …存在误差。选项[C]意思是“夸大了现场表演的多样性”，原文没有提到。

24.【答案】[D] 
 　 【解析】推断题。关于recordings，作者主要在第四段加以论述。从第四段第三句“These recordings are cheap，available everywhere…”和第四段最后一句“the widespread availability of such recordings has thus brought …。”很容易推断出选项[B] They are easily accessible to the general public(大众很容易就能得到这些唱片)为正确答案。

　　干扰项：选项[A]意思是“唱片在质量方面经常是次于现场音乐会”，由第四段第三句“These recordings are cheap…very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances” 可知选项[A]是错误的。选项[C]“他们帮助提高了音乐的品质”是对文中“These recordings …very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances”的曲解。选项[D]太过绝对，无法从文中推出。

25.【答案】[A] 
 　 【解析】态度题。本题考查作者对于Gilbert在振兴交响乐团中的作用是什么态度。文章最后一段，尤其是最后三句提到，“But what will be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra’s repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the relationship between America’s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hopes to attract。”很明显作者认为“Gilbert与众不同的实质仅仅是增加了管弦乐队的节目，这是不够的”，“Gilbert和the Philharmonic要想成功，还必须做一些事情”，由此可知作者不满意Gilbert在振兴交响乐团中的作用。故[A]项doubtful(怀疑的)为正确答案。

　　干扰项：[B]项enthusiastic(充满热情的)和[C]项confident(有信心)为反面干扰项。[D]项puzzled(迷惑的)是不符合常识的，作者不可能对其论述的内容迷惑不解，故排除。

 

**Text 2**

26.【答案】[B] 

【解析】细节题。题目问到“当McGee宣布他离开时，对他的态度可以最好的描述为    。”文章首段首句提到，“When Liam McGee departed …, his explanation was surprisingly straight up。”，即“当Liam McGee离开时，他的解释是直率的”，后文具体描述时还提到，“Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual vague excuses, he came right out and said …”，即“他不是用通常模糊的理由掩饰他的离开，而是坦率地说……”，所以正确答案为[B]项frank(坦率的)，是对文中“straight up”和“right out”的同义替换。

　　干扰项：[A]项arrogant(傲慢的)是从文中broadcasting his ambition过度推理而来的，不能选；[C]项self-centered(自我为中心的)是从“was very much my decision”主观臆断来的，不能选；[D]项impulsive(冲动的)是近义干扰，但是在原文中找不到依据。

 

27.【答案】[D] 
 　 【解析】细节题。本题问驱使高级管理人员离职的可能原因。文章第二段首先谈到，McGee思考他想要经营什么样的公司，他的离职给外界传递了他的aspirations(渴望)。第三句And McGee isn’t alone。谈到不光McGee是这种情况，言外之意是“很多高级管理人员是同样的情况”，下面举例谈到“… the No. 2 executives at Avon and American Express … quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post”，即高管辞职是因为他们有新的渴望，追求新的职业目标。故[D]项their pursuit of new career goals(他们追求新的职业目标)为正确答案。

干扰项：[A]项中的financial status在本段范围内未提及；[B]项中的reflect on their private life是对文中reflect on what kind of company he wanted to run的严重曲解；[C]项是根据第二段倒数第二句编造的选项，选项内容与原文不符且不能回答本题提问，故为干扰项。

28.【答案】[C] 
 　 【解析】词义题。第四段首句是该段中心句，谈到辞去高级职位寻找更好职位的决定不是常规的。后文围绕该中心句论述。要推断的词poached出现在该段第二句中：For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive CEO candidates are the ones who must be poached。意思是“多年来高官们和猎头坚持这一原则：最新吸引人的CEO候选人一定会……”，从含义上我们可以推断出be poached的含义为“被寻找、被注意到、被重视”的意思。故从[B]项和[C]项中选答案。考虑到[C]项中的hunted for含义正确，且是文中出现的headhunters和search的同义替换，证据确凿，故为正确答案。

　　干扰项：[A]项approved of(被赞成)、[B]项attended of(被照顾、被看护)含义不准确。[D]项guarded against(被预防)与原文意思相反。

29.【答案】[A] 
 　 【解析】推断题。该段第二句提到，The financial crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one，意思是金融危机使得跳槽或离开糟糕的岗位更可被接受。后面引用一个猎头的话进一步证明这一观点，猎头说：传统的规则认为呆在原地更安全，但是这已经从根本上改变了。那些最受伤的人们是那些呆最长时间的人。[A]项top performers used to cling to their posts(高管过去常常坚持他们的岗位)是对文中“The traditional rule was it’s safer to say where you are, but that’s been fundamentally inverted”的同义替换。

　　干扰项：[B]项中提到的loyalty一词是原文没有的概念，“不呆在原岗位”与“忠诚过时”不是同一个概念。[C]项是根据该段首句改编的选项，但与首句含义相反。[D]项与本段的核心信息相反。

30.【答案】[C] 
 　 【解析】本文以Liam McGee的故事开头，他宣布离职的方式非常坦率，两周后找到了新职位。第二段继续谈到，McGee在没有找到新职位的情况下离开，这给了他思考未来的时间，同他一样，高管们离职的原因是要去追求新的职业目标。第三段中心是，高管们更愿意在没有新职位的情况下跳槽。第四段的中心是辞去高级职位然后去寻找更好的工作不是常规做法。第五段谈到没有工作就跳槽的那些人并不总是很快就有高职位。第六段讲如今跳槽或离开不好的工作更为可取。文章一直在重复一个主题“高管们辞职后再去找新工作”，故[C]项Top Managers Jump without a Net(高管们在没有新工作的情况下辞职)为正确答案。文中的“McGee leaving without a position lined up，deputy chiefs may be more willing to make the jump without a net，to quit a position to look for a better one，jump without a job”都在重复这个主题。

　　干扰项：[A]项CEOs: Where to Go(CEO们：路在何方？)，文中并没有谈及CEO们的出路问题，故不能概括文章主旨；[B]项CEOs: All the Way Up?( CEO们：一路向上？)，很宽泛，没能准确反映中心；[D]项中的only太过绝对，不能成为文章主旨。

31.【答案】[D] 
 　 【解析】细节题。题目“当消费者______时，可能会造就‘免费’媒体”。定位到第一段第三句前半句话“Consumers passionate about a product may create “earned” media by willingly promoting it to friends”，意思是“消费者由于很喜欢某个产品，故主动地将之向朋友推荐，由此造就了‘免费’媒体”，选项[D] enthusiastic about recommending their favorite products(热衷于向朋友推荐他们最喜欢的产品)。

　　干扰项：[A] obsessed with online shopping at certain web sites (沉迷于在某个网站进行网购)，而文中未提到网络购买。[B] inspired by product-promotion e-mails sent to them (受到产品促销邮件的鼓励)，文中消费者向朋友推荐喜欢的商品是他们的主动行为，而非被动。[C] eager to help their friends promote quality products (热心帮助朋友推荐高质量的产品)，文中是向朋友推荐，而非帮朋友推荐，故排除。

32.【答案】[C] 
 　 【解析】细节推断题。题目“由第二段可知，收费媒体的特点是_____”。定位到第二段第四句“We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-ecommerce engines within that envrionment”，由此句可知收费媒体(sold media)是指那些流量非常大的免费媒体，由于他们的流量如此之大以至于其他的机构也乐于把自己的产品信息或者电子上午引擎置于这些免费媒体中，于是就会向免费媒体购买广告位置(结合本段第三句理解)，由此可知选项[C] strong user traffic(强大的用户流量)为正确答案。

　　干扰项：[A] a safe business environment (安全的商业环境)[B] random competition (自由竞争)[D] flexibility in organization (组织灵活)均非文中信息，无中生有。

33.【答案】[B] 
 　 【解析】细节题。题目“第三段中，作者认为免费媒体______”。第三段提到免费媒体提供便利的同时，也带来了风险，比如可能被利用去传播某个品牌或产品的负面信息，由此可知选项[B] can be used to produce negative effects in marketing (可能会被用来制造对营销不利的负面影响)正符合此意。

　　干扰项：[A] invite constant conflicts with passionate consumers (导致不断与热情的消费者产生冲突)，为反向干扰。[C] may be responsible for fiercer competition (可能会造成更激烈的竞争)，非第三段讲解的内容。[D] deserve all the negative comments about them (应该受到所有这些负面的批评)，原文提到会有负面批评，但未提及是他们应得的，为主观臆断。

34.【答案】[A] 
 　 【解析】例证题。题目“Toyota Motor是一个_______的例子”。定位到末段，末段主要提到热情的消费者可能会号召其他人抵制某个产品，威胁到产品所属公司的名声，这时公司的回应有可能不够迅速、周到。这是本段的核心信息。接下来就拿Toyota Motor举例，举例中提到这个公司在公司名声遇到如上提到的危机情况时作出的反应，且成功减轻了危害程度。由此可知，例子是对本段中心句的一个反面例子论证公司对hijacked media的反应。故选项[A](有效地回应被劫持利用的媒体)为正确答案。

　　干扰项：[B] persuading customers into boycotting products (劝说消费者抵制产品)，文中末段第一句提到了消费者可能会劝说其他人抵制某些产品，故为张冠李戴。[C] cooperating with supportive consumers (与支持自己的消费者合作)，在例子中提到Toyota Motor公司缓解危机的方式是与消费者直接沟通，这首先属于例子内的信息，不符合例证题的解题思路，其次沟通交流不等于合作，故排除。[D] taking advantage of hijacked media (利用被劫持的媒体)，文中是消除被劫持媒体带来的危害，而非去利用被劫持的媒体，故排除。

35.【答案】[A] 
 　 【解析】主旨题。题目“这篇文化在那个主要讲述的是______”。本文首段第三句就提出文章中心“companies today can exploit many alternative forms of media”，即虽然传统收费媒体仍在发挥重大作用，但是现今的公司可以去选择其他媒体形式。后文主要是介绍其他可选择的媒体形式，并对其作出评论。故选项[A] Alternatives to conventional paid media (与传统收费媒体对应的其他媒体形式)为正确答案。

　　干扰项：[B] Conflict between hijacked and earned media (被劫持媒体和免费媒体之间的冲突)[C] Dominance of hijacked media (被劫持媒体的支配地位)[D] Popularity of owned media (免费媒体的普遍性)均为文中的部分信息，不足以概括全文，故都排除。

 

**Text 4**

36.【答案】[C] 
 　 【解析】细节题。题目“Jenifer Senior在她的文章中认为养育孩子可以带来_____”。定位到第一段第二句“Senior suggests that we need to redefine happiness: instead of thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-to-moment joy, we should consider being happy as a past-tense condition”，意思是说我们应该把幸福看作为一种“过去时”的状态，而不应该把它看作为一种可以即时即地的快乐。最后一句补充道，那些一开始让我们情绪低落的事情，后来可能会是强烈的满足和快乐感的来源。由此可知，选项[C] happiness in retrospect(幸福的回忆、回顾往事时的幸福感)为正确答案。

　　干扰项：[A] temporary delight(暂时的快乐)，为反向干扰。[B] enjoyment in progress(慢慢增加的快乐)，不符合原文过去(沮丧)与后来(幸福快乐)的对比。[D] lasting reward(持久的回报)为无中生有。

37.【答案】[D] 
 　 【解析】推断题。题目“由第二段可知_____”。定位到第二段。第二段是承接第一段中心“养育孩子能成为后来幸福快乐的源泉”而来的，符合中心表达的意思。而且在第三段首句接着第二段提到“in a society that so persistently celebrates procreation(在一个如此赞扬生育的社会中)”，这是一个承上启下的句子，是对第二段的总结，也符合第一段以及第二段对养育孩子的正面评价。故选项[D] having children is highly valued by the public (养育孩子受到大众的高度重视)，是对原文赞扬生育的同义替换，为正确答案。

　　干扰项：[A] celebrity moms are a permanent source for gossip (名人妈妈是八卦的不竭来源)、[B] single mothers with babies deserve greater attention (带孩子的单身母亲应该得到更多的关注)、[C] news about pregnant celebrities is entertaining (名人怀孕的新闻更具有娱乐性)，均偏离文章中心。

38.【答案】[A] 
 　 【解析】细节推断题。题目“由第三段可知，无儿女的人们会_____”。第三段最后一句but后面的信息提到，不幸福但育有儿女的父母很少会遭到挑衅，而去思考他们当初是不是不应该要孩子，但是不幸福且无儿女的人们经常会受到一个信息的困扰，即孩子是世界上唯一最重要的事情。后面又补充道，很明显正是没有孩子这一人生中的空白导直接导致了他们的痛苦。故选项[A] are constantly exposed to criticism (常常是指责的对象)符合此意，为正确答案。

　　干扰项：[B] are largely ignored by the media (在很大程度上为媒体所忽视)，媒体关注的对象的确不是那些不养育孩子的人们，但这不是第三段的内容，故排除。[C] fail to fulfill their social responsibilities (未能履行他们的社会责任)，文中未提到社会责任这一说，而且本文中心也非讨论不养育孩子人们的社会责任问题，故排除。[D] are less likely to be satisfied with their life (更有可能对自己的生活不满)，文中比较的是不幸福的有儿女的父母和不幸福的无儿女的人们，但没有明确说哪类人更满意自己的生活，故排除。

39.【答案】[D] 
 　  【解析】细节题。题目中“名人杂志传达的信息是_____”。定位到原文第四段第一句“the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like Us Weekly and People present is hugely unrealistic”，名人杂志中为人父母的形象是非常不现实的。选项[D] misleading(误导的)是对原文unrealistic的同义替换。

干扰选项：[A] soothing (抚慰的，令人宽心的)、[B] ambiguous (模糊的)、[C] compensatory (补偿的)均为无中生有。

40.【答案】[B] 
 　 【解析】推断题。题目“从最后一段我们可以推断出如下哪个选项”。定位到最后一段转折处“But it’s interesting to wonder if the images we see every week of stress-free, happiness-enhancing parenthood aren’t in some small, subconscious way contributing to our own satisfactions with the actual experience, in the say way that a small part of us hoped getting ‘the Rachel’ might make us just a little bit like Jennifer Anniston”，意思为我们每周看到的名人形象(没有压力、提升幸福感的名人形象)会使我们潜意识中对现实经历有所不满。由此可知，选项[B] Celebrity moms have influenced out attitude towards child rearing (名人妈妈形象影响了我们对抚养孩子的态度)是正确的。

　　干扰选项：[A] Having children contributes little to the glamour of celebrity moms(生育孩子对名人妈妈的魅力影响不大)，与末段第一句相反，为反向干扰。[C] Having children intensifies our dissatisfaction with life(生育孩子加剧了我们对生活的不满)，为反向干扰，原因：最后一段第一句提到养孩子在杂志上是魅力无穷的，但在现实中大多数成年人都懂得养孩子不像理发那么简单，接下来一句转而说杂志上的名人形象到底还是影响到了人们对养育孩子的态度。[D] We sometimes neglect the happiness from child rearing (我们有时会忽略养育孩子带来的幸福感)，在原文中没提到忽略这种幸福感，属于无中生有。

 

**Part B**

41．【答案】[B] 
 　 【解析】从给出的开头段落G，可以看出这是一篇介绍Louis Menand的书The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University和他的观点的文章，紧接着下面就应该讲他书中阐释的问题和他的观点，B选项中开头一句提到his concern，暗示提出问题，指出美国大学存在的主要问题。从结构上来看，B选项内容能够合理地与G选项衔接，故41题正确答案为B选项。

42.【答案】[D] 
 　 【解析】文章的主题是关于“humanities”。上一段提出大学人文学科正走向没落，所以下面就紧接着应该解释出现这种现象的原因，42项答案即D或者E，但因为E在后一项给出，且有连接词Besides可知，42为D。此外，D选项中首句出现的separate一词，与E选项中this separation正好构成关联，故42题应选D选项。

43.【答案】[A] 
 　 【解析】A选项指出，没有哪门专业化学科像人文学科这样，需要倾注如此多的热情，之后提到获得人文学科的博士学位，需要9年的时间，这一信息可对应E选项中的the acquisition of a doctoral，从结构和内容构成了合理的衔接，所以43题应选择A。

 

44.【答案】[C] 
 　 【解析】依据43题的选项A，说人文学科获得博士学位的时间长，需要倾注很大的热情，所以高达一半的英语博士生在获得学位之前辍学就毫不奇怪了。从剩下的选项中，首先排除F，因为F的“conclude”可知F项应为全文的总结。从C的“Equally unsurprisingly，only about half end up with the jobs they entered graduate school to get: tenured professorships。”可知，C是紧接着A，所以44题选C。

45.【答案】[F] 
 　 【解析】由F选项内容可知，该段进行总结说明，往往也出现在文章末尾，应将F选项放在文章末段，故F选项为45题的答案。

　　

**Part C Translation**

46.Allen’s contribution was to take an assumption we all share---that because we are not robots we therefore control our thoughts---and reveal its erroneous nature。

　　【考查分析】本题考点：同位语从句， 定语从句

　　【答案解析】本句的主干是Allen’s contribution was to take an assumption and reveal its erroneous nature。破折号后面的that引导同位语从句，对前面的assumption解释说明。We all share是定语从句，修饰assumption。

　　【参考译文】我们每个人都认为：自己不是机器人，因此能够控制自己的思想；爱伦的贡献在于他研究了这一假说，并揭示其错误的本质。

47.While we may be able to sustain the illusion of control through the conscious mind alone, in reality we are continually faced with a question: “Why cannot I make myself do this or achieve that?”

　　【考查分析】本题考点：状语从句

　　【答案解析】本句结构特别清晰，主干是While we may be able to sustain …. ,we are faced with a question…。while引导让步状语从句，后面“Why cannot I make myself do this or achieve that?”是question 的具体内容。本句采用顺译法。

　　【参考译文】我们或许只通过意识就能维持这种控制的幻觉，但事实上，我们却总是面临一个问题：我们为什么不能让自己去做这件事情，实现那个目标呢？

　　48.This seems a justification for neglect of those in need, and a rationalization of exploitation, of the superiority of those at the top and the inferiority of those at the bottom。

　　【考查分析】本题考点： 省略、介词短语、复杂表语

　　【答案解析】本句的主体结构为：This seems a justification and a rationalization。 本句的难点在于运用很多介词短语作后置定语，介词短语套介词短语，使得宾语非常复杂。“for neglect of those in need”修饰“justification”、“of exploration”、“of the superiority”“of the inferiority” 修饰rationalization。而“of those at the top”和“of those at the bottom”又分别修饰superiority和inferiority。

　　【参考译文】这种说法似乎为忽视需要帮助的人找到了借口，使剥削合理化，令上层人优越，底层人卑微。

　　49.circumstances seem to be designed to bring out the best in us, and if we feel that we have been “wronged” then we are unlikely to begin a conscious effort to escape from our situation。

　　【考查分析】本题考点：并列从句，定语从句。

　　【答案解析】本句主体结构是：circumstances seem to be designed to…., and if we feel that… then we are unlikely to… “环境好像是为…,而设计，如果我们感受到…,我们就不可能…”； “bring out” 是产生、使…显示出来；“wronged” 是“被冤枉，被委屈”的意思，“be (un)likely to do” (不) 可能做某事；

　　【参考译文】环境似乎旨在激发我们的最大潜能，如果我们总感觉“上天不公”，那么不太可能会自觉地努力脱离现状。

　　50.The upside is the possibilities contained in knowing that everything is up to us; where before we were experts in the array of limitations, now we become authorities of what is possible. 

　　【考查分析】本题考点：主系表结构、分词短语的用法、连词where引导的状语从句。

　　【答案解析】本句主体结构为The upside is the possibilities，译为“正面意义在于可能性”。Contained in knowing that everything is up to us，是过去分词结构作后置定语。分号后面是一个有连词where引导的状语从句。Where 在这里是“在某种情况下(in what situation, to what point)的意思。

　　【参考译文】积极的一面是，既然万事都取决于我们，那么就有无限可能。以前，我们能够熟练应对种种局限；现在，我们把握着未来的可能。

　　The terrible scene depicted in the cartoon shows that some people in our life still lack the awareness of environmental protection. The picture illustrates that two tourists are chatting and eating happily on a boat and casually throwing their rubbish into the lake which is full of litter and waste. The drawing sets us thinking too much due to its far-reaching influence。

　　Nowadays, though the awareness of protecting environment is being accepted by more and more people, we can still see many unpleasant scenes especially in scenic spots. Why does this phenomenon arise? Many factors are accounting for it. First and foremost, to some people, the consciousness of protecting environment is still not so strong. They may not think it is a big deal to throw rubbish everywhere. In addition, the environmental management system isn’t so satisfying. For example, in some places there’re few regulations or the implementation is seldom performed actually。

　　From what has been discussed above, it is urgent to take some effective and relative measures. In the first place, we should continue to conduct more propaganda in communities and schools so as to let people realize the importance of protecting environment. In the second, more rules should be made and carried out by the government to restrain the conduction of destroying environment. People should work together to create clean and beautiful surroundings。

**Directions:**

　　Read the following text. Choose the best word(s) for each numbered blank and mark [A], [B], [C] or [D] on **ANSWER SHEET 1**. (10 points)

In 1924 America's National Research Council sent two engineers to supervise a series of industrial experiments at a large telephone-parts factory called the Hawthorne Plant near Chicago. It hoped they would learn how stop-floor lighting  workers' productivity. Instead, the studies ended  giving their name to the "Hawthorne effect", the extremely influential idea that the very  to being experimented upon changed subjects' behavior.

The idea arose because of the  behavior of the women in the Hawthorne plant. According to  of the experiments, their hourly output rose when lighting was increased, but also when it was dimmed. It did not  what was done in the experiment;  something was changed, productivity rose. A(n)  that they were being experimented upon seemed to be  to alter workers' behavior  itself.

After several decades, the same data were  to econometric the analysis. Hawthorne experiments has another surprise store the descriptions on record, no systematic  was found that levels of productivity were related to changes in lighting.

It turns out that peculiar way of conducting the experiments may be have let to  interpretation of what happed. , lighting was always changed on a Sunday. When work started again on Monday, output  rose compared with the previous Saturday and  to rise for the next couple of days. , a comparison with data for weeks when there was no experimentation showed that output always went up on Monday, workers  to be diligent for the first few days of the week in any case, before  a plateau and then slackening off. This suggests that the alleged "Hawthorne effect" is hard to pin down.

#### Text 1

Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century, perhaps the most far-reaching has been the inexorable decline in the scope and seriousness of their arts coverage. 

It is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most big-city newspapers. Yet a considerable number of the most significant collections of criticism published in the 20th century consisted in large part of newspaper reviews. To read such books today is to marvel at the fact that their learned contents were once deemed suitable for publication in general-circulation dailies.

We are even farther removed from the unfocused newspaper reviews published in England between the turn of the 20th century and the eve of World War II, at a time when newsprint was dirt-cheap and stylish arts criticism was considered an ornament to the publications in which it appeared. In those far-off days, it was taken for granted that the critics of major papers would write in detail and at length about the events they covered. Theirs was a serious business, and even those reviewers who wore their learning lightly, like George Bernard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could be trusted to know what they were about. These men believed in journalism as a calling, and were proud to be published in the daily press. “So few authors have brains enough or literary gift enough to keep their own end up in journalism,” Newman wrote, “that I am tempted to define ‘journalism’ as ‘a term of contempt applied by writers who are not read to writers who are.’”

Unfortunately, these critics are virtually forgotten. Neville Cardus, who wrote for the *Manchester Guardian* from 1917 until shortly before his death in 1975, is now known solely as a writer of essays on the game of cricket. During his lifetime, though, he was also one of England’s foremost classical-music critics, a stylist so widely admired that his *Autobiography* (1947) became a best-seller. He was knighted in 1967, the first music critic to be so honored. Yet only one of his books is now in print, and his vast body of writings on music is unknown save to specialists.

Is there any chance that Cardus’s criticism will enjoy a revival? The prospect seems remote. Journalistic tastes had changed long before his death, and postmodern readers have little use for the richly upholstered Vicwardian prose in which he specialized. Moreover, the amateur tradition in music criticism has been in headlong retreat.

 

\21.   It is indicated in Paragraphs 1 and 2 that

[A] arts criticism has disappeared from big-city newspapers.

[B] English-language newspapers used to carry more arts reviews.

[C] high-quality newspapers retain a large body of readers.

[D] young readers doubt the suitability of criticism on dailies.

\22.   Newspaper reviews in England before World War II were characterized by

[A] free themes.

[B] casual style.

[C] elaborate layout.

[D] radical viewpoints.

\23.   Which of the following would Shaw and Newman most probably agree on?

[A] It is writers' duty to fulfill journalistic goals.

[B] It is contemptible for writers to be journalists.

[C] Writers are likely to be tempted into journalism.

[D] Not all writers are capable of journalistic writing.

\24.   What can be learned about Cardus according to the last two paragraphs?

[A] His music criticism may not appeal to readers today.

[B] His reputation as a music critic has long been in dispute.

[C] His style caters largely to modern specialists.

[D] His writings fail to follow the amateur tradition.

Over the past decade, thousands of patents have been granted for what are called business methods. Amazon.com received one for its "one-click" online payment system. Merrill Lynch got legal protection for an asset allocation strategy. One inventor patented a technique for lifting a box.

Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready to scale back on business-method patents, which have been controversial ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago. In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz the U.S. court of Appeals for the federal circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad review of business-method patents. *In re Bilski*, as the case is known , is "a very big deal", says Dennis D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of law. It "has the potential to eliminate an entire class of patents."

Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it was the federal circuit itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 decision in the so-called state Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. That ruling produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by emerging internet companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to specific types of online transactions. Later, more established companies raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move against rivals that might beat them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in a court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method patents despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting them. Similarly, some Wall Street investment films armed themselves with patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court cases opposing the practice.

The Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk in the energy market. The Federal circuit issued an unusual order stating that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court's judges, rather than a typical panel of three, and that one issue it wants to evaluate is whether it should "reconsider" its state street Bank ruling.

The Federal Circuit's action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by the supreme Court that has narrowed the scope of protections for patent holders. Last April, for example the justices signaled that too many patents were being upheld for "inventions" that are obvious. The judges on the Federal circuit are "reacting to the anti-patent trend at the Supreme Court", says Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School.

\26.   Business-method patents have recently aroused concern because of

[A] their limited value to business

[B] their connection with asset allocation

[C] the possible restriction on their granting

[D] the controversy over their authorization

\27.   Which of the following is true of the Bilski case?

[A] Its ruling complies with the court decisions

[B] It involves a very big business transaction

[C] It has been dismissed by the Federal Circuit

[D] It may change the legal practices in the U.S.

\28.   The word "about-face" (Line 1, Para 3) most probably means

[A] loss of good will

[B] increase of hostility

[C] change of attitude

[D] enhancement of dignity

\29.   We learn from the last two paragraphs that business-method patents

[A] are immune to legal challenges

[B] are often unnecessarily issued

[C] lower the esteem for patent holders

[D] increase the incidence of risks

\30.   Which of the following would be the subject of the text?

[A] A looming threat to business-method patents

[B] Protection for business-method patent holders

[C] A legal case regarding business-method patents

[D] A prevailing trend against business-method patents

In his book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell argues that social epidemics are driven in large part by the acting of a tiny minority of special individuals, often called influentials, who are unusually informed, persuasive, or well-connected. The idea is intuitively compelling, but it doesn't explain how ideas actually spread.

The supposed importance of influentials derives from a plausible sounding but largely untested theory called the "two step flow of communication": Information flows from the media to the influentials and from them to everyone else. Marketers have embraced the two-step flow because it suggests that if they can just find and influence the influentials, those selected people will do most of the work for them. The theory also seems to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity of certain looks, brands, or neighborhoods. In many such cases, a cursory search for causes finds that some small group of people was wearing, promoting, or developing whatever it is before anyone else paid attention. Anecdotal evidence of this kind fits nicely with the idea that only certain special people can drive trends

In their recent work, however, some researchers have come up with the finding that influentials have far less impact on social epidemics than is generally supposed. In fact, they don't seem to be required of all.

The researchers' argument stems from a simple observing about social influence, with the exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey—whose outsize presence is primarily a function of media, not interpersonal, influence—even the most influential members of a population simply don't interact with that many others. Yet it is precisely these non-celebrity influentials who, according to the two-step-flow theory, are supposed to drive social epidemics by influencing their friends and colleagues directly. For a social epidemic to occur, however, each person so affected, must then influence his or her own acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on; and just how many others pay attention to each of these people has little to do with the initial influential. If people in the network just two degrees removed from the initial influential prove resistant, for example, the cascade of change won't propagate very far or affect many people.

Building on the basic truth about interpersonal influence, the researchers studied the dynamics of populations manipulating a number of variables relating of populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people's ability to influence others and their tendency to be influenced. Our work shows that the principal requirement for what we call "global cascades" – the widespread propagation of influence through networks – is the presence not of a few influentials but, rather, of a critical mass of easily influenced people.

\31.   By citing the book The Tipping Point, the author intends to

[A] analyze the consequences of social epidemics

[B] discuss influentials' function in spreading ideas

[C] exemplify people's intuitive response to social epidemics

\32.   The author suggests that the "two-step-flow theory"

[A] serves as a solution to marketing problems

[B] has helped explain certain prevalent trends

[C] has won support from influentials

[D] requires solid evidence for its validity

\33.   What the researchers have observed recently shows that

[A] the power of influence goes with social interactions

[B] interpersonal links can be enhanced through the media

[C] influentials have more channels to reach the public

[D] most celebrities enjoy wide media attention

\34.   The underlined phrase "these people" in paragraph 4 refers to the ones who

[A] stay outside the network of social influence

[B] have little contact with the source of influence

[C] are influenced and then influence others

[D] are influenced by the initial influential

\35.   what is the essential element in the dynamics of social influence?

[A] The eagerness to be accepted

[B] The impulse to influence others

[C] The readiness to be influenced

[D] The inclination to rely on others

Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. Behind the scenes, they have been taking aim at someone else: the accounting standard-setters. Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it's just not fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch.

Unfortunately, banks' lobbying now seems to be working. The details may be unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, essential to the proper functioning of capital markets, is being compromised. And, unless banks carry toxic assets at prices that attract buyers, reviving the banking system will be difficult.

After a bruising encounter with Congress, America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rushed through rule changes. These gave banks more freedom to use models to value illiquid assets and more flexibility in recognizing losses on long-term assets in their income statement. Bob Herz, the FASB's chairman, cried out against those who "question our motives." Yet bank shares rose and the changes enhance what one lobby group politely calls "the use of judgment by management."

European ministers instantly demanded that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) do likewise. The IASB says it does not want to act without overall planning, but the pressure to fold when it completes it reconstruction of rules later this year is strong. Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the IASB that it did "not live in a political vacuum" but "in the real word" and that Europe could yet develop different rules.

It was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that vastly overvalued assets. Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. The truth will not be known for years. But bank's shares trade below their book value, suggesting that investors are skeptical. And dead markets partly reflect the paralysis of banks which will not sell assets for fear of booking losses, yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed bargains.

To get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt with. America's new plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless banks mark assets to levels which buyers find attractive. Successful markets require independent and even combative standard-setters. The FASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up rules on stock options and pensions, for example, against hostility from special interests. But by giving in to critics now they are inviting pressure to make more concessions.

\36.   Bankers complained that they were forced to

[A] follow unfavorable asset evaluation rules

[B] collect payments from third parties

[C] cooperate with the price managers

[D] reevaluate some of their assets.

\37.   According to the author , the rule changes of the FASB may result in

[A] the diminishing role of management

[B] the revival of the banking system

[C] the banks' long-term asset losses

[D] the weakening of its independence

\38.   According to Paragraph 4, McCreevy objects to the IASB's attempt to

[A] keep away from political influences.

[B] evade the pressure from their peers.

[C] act on their own in rule-setting.

[D] take gradual measures in reform.

\39.   The author thinks the banks were "on the wrong planet" in that they

[A] misinterpreted market price indicators

[B] exaggerated the real value of their assets

[C] neglected the likely existence of bad debts.

[D] denied booking losses in their sale of assets.

\40.   The author's attitude towards standard-setters is one of

[A] satisfaction.

[B] skepticism.

[C] objectiveness

[D] sympathy

 

### Part B

**Directions:**

For Questions 41-45, choose the most suitable paragraphs from the list A-G and fill them into the numbered boxes to form a coherent text. Paragraph E has been correctly placed. There is one paragraph which does not fit in with the text. Mark your answers on **ANSWER SHEET1**. (10 points)

[A] The first and more important is the consumer's growing preference for eating out; the consumption of food and drink in places other than homes has risen from about 32 percent of total consumption in 1995 to 35 percent in 2000 and is expected to approach 38 percent by 2005. This development is boosting wholesale demand from the food service segment by 4 to 5 percent a year across Europe, compared with growth in retail demand of 1 to 2 percent. Meanwhile, as the recession is looming large, people are getting anxious. They tend to keep a tighter hold on their purse and consider eating at home a realistic alternative.

[B] Retail sales of food and drink in Europe's largest markets are at a standstill, leaving European grocery retailers hungry for opportunities to grow. Most leading retailers have already tried e-commerce, with limited success, and expansion abroad. But almost all have ignored the big, profitable opportunity in their own backyard: the wholesale food and drink trade, which appears to be just the kind of market retailers need.

[C] Will such variations bring about a change in the overall structure of the food and drink market? Definitely not. The functioning of the market is based on flexible trends dominated by potential buyers. In other words, it is up to the buyer, rather than the seller, to decide what to buy .At any rate, this change will ultimately be acclaimed by an ever-growing number of both domestic and international consumers, regardless of how long the current consumer pattern will take hold.

[D] All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which big retailers could profitably apply their scale, existing infrastructure and proven skills in the management of product ranges, logistics, and marketing intelligence. Retailers that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe may well expect to rake in substantial profits thereby. At least, that is how it looks as a whole. Closer inspection reveals important differences among the biggest national markets, especially in their customer segments and wholesale structures, as well as the competitive dynamics of individual food and drink categories. Big retailers must understand these differences before they can identify the segments of European wholesaling in which their particular abilities might unseat smaller but entrenched competitors. New skills and unfamiliar business models are needed too.

[E] Despite variations in detail, wholesale markets in the countries that have been closely examined—France, Germany, Italy, and Spain—are made out of the same building blocks. Demand comes mainly from two sources: independent mom-and-pop grocery stores which, unlike large retail chains, are too small to buy straight from producers, and food service operators that cater to consumers when they don't eat at home. Such food service operators range from snack machines to large institutional catering ventures, but most of these businesses are known in the trade as "horeca": hotels, restaurants, and cafes. Overall, Europe's wholesale market for food and drink is growing at the same sluggish pace as the retail market, but the figures, when added together, mask two opposing trends.

[F] For example, wholesale food and drink sales come to $268 billion in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom in 2000—more than 40 percent of retail sales. Moreover, average overall margins are higher in wholesale than in retail; wholesale demand from the food service sector is growing quickly as more Europeans eat out more often; and changes in the competitive dynamics of this fragmented industry are at last making it feasible for wholesalers to consolidate.

[G] However, none of these requirements should deter large retailers (and even some large good producers and existing wholesalers) from trying their hand, for those that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe stand to reap considerable gains.

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written carefully on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (10 points)

One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is that most members of the land community have no economic value. Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community and, if its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to continuance.

When one of these noneconomic categories is threatened and, if we happen to love it .We invert excuses to give it economic importance. At the beginning of century songbirds were supposed to be disappearing. (46) Scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them. the evidence had to be economic in order to be valid.

It is painful to read these round about accounts today. We have no land ethic yet, (47) but we have at least drawn near the point of admitting that birds should continue as a matter of intrinsic right, regardless of the presence or absence of economic advantage to us.

A parallel situation exists in respect of predatory mammals and fish-eating birds. (48) Time was when biologists somewhat over worded the evidence that these creatures preserve the health of game by killing the physically weak, or that they prey only on "worthless" species.

Some species of tree have been read out of the party by economics-minded foresters because they grow too slowly, or have too low a sale vale to pay as timber crops. (49) In Europe, where forestry is ecologically more advanced, the non-commercial tree species are recognized as members of native forest community, to be preserved as such, within reason.

To sum up: a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided. (50) It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are essential to its healthy functioning. It assumes, falsely, I think, that the economic parts of the biotic clock will function without the uneconomic parts.

 　  【解析】细节题。文章提到Tipping Point真本书描述社会流行风潮是由一小部分名人引起的，然而，笔锋一转在首段末又说"it doesn't explain how ideas actually spread"。进而引出作者对名人传播想法功能的讨论。由此B选项正确。而A、C、D 均不是作者要讨论的问题。

\32. 【答案】[D] 
 　  【解析】细节题。文章第二段首句 "the supposed…plausible sounding but largely untested theory。."以及末句"…only certain special people can drive trends"充分说明这种理论证据不够充足。而D选项正确的反应了文中的内容。

\33. 【答案】[A] 
 　  【解析】根据题干，线索大致定位到第三段，但是第三段并没有清晰的找到题解，而接下来的第四段清晰的反应出了社会互动所产生的巨大影响这一内容。A选项充分的表明了这一点。

\34. 【答案】[C] 
 　  【解析】根据题干，线索定位到第四段。同过分析这个短语所在的句子，"For a social epidemic…;just how many others pay attention to each of these people has little to do with…"此句主要表明人们是如何被别人影响进而又去影响别人的。而C选项恰是对这一点的正确表述。

\35. 【答案】[C] 
 　  【解析】细节题。根据题干，线索定位到最后一段，从"…relating of populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people's ability to influence others and their tendency to be…"这句话中能够得知社会影响动力因素包括人们影响别人的能力包括被别人影响的倾向性。而C选项充分的体现了这一点。

 

**Text 4**

\36. 【答案】[A] 
 　  【解析】细节题。答案意为"遵循不利的资产评估准则"。

由题干中的 "Bankers complained" 和 "force"定位于第一段第三行 "Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it's just not fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch。" 该句核心词为rules，四个答案中只有A选项包含。

\37. 【答案】[A] 
 　  【解析】推理引申题。答案意为"管理的作用的逐渐消失"。根据题干中的专有名词FASB定位于第三段。第一句提到FASB经过努力使国会通过了一些变革，这些变革赋予了银行更多的权利，也就是说对银行的管理更为松散，所以答案为"管理的作用的逐渐消失"。

38.【答案】[C] 
 　  【解析】细节题。答案意为"独立自主的制定法规"。根据题干中的  "McCreevy objects to"定位到第五段。第五段提到立即根据美国的变化做出一样的反应，欧洲的各界人士对此的反对十分强烈，引用McCreevy的话是为了说明这一点：欧洲要对这个问题有自己独立的法律法规。

\39. 【答案】[C] 
 　  【解析】句意题。答案意为"忽视了坏账存在的极大可能性"。根据题干的信息定位到第六段Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts。批判银行一味的夸大"that market prices overstate losses"，而忽视了"the likely extent of bad debts"。

\40. 【答案】[D] 
 　  【解析】情感态度题。文章讨论了银行针对"standard-setters"的敌意行为，特别是文章最后一段更是明确的表明了作者对"standard-setters"的同情。

 

**Part B**

\41. 【答案】[B] 
 　  【解析】本题需要找出文章的首段，可用排除法做。首先A 选项中提到"the first and more important…"中的 "more" 应该在前文中提到，故排除。B选项首句就提出了欧洲食品零售所面临的问题，根据文章结构法：提出问题-分析问题-解决问题，此段符合首段要求，即提出了文章的中心问题，而且本选项中也没有明显的需要和上文衔接的关系词，而其它选项都有明显的与上文衔接的信息词，不能在首段出现，故B为正确答案。

\42. 【答案】[F] 
 　  【解析】首段一旦确定，本段内容便可根据上文顺藤摸瓜，第一段最后一句话"but"后指出了虽然食品零售商面临着"at a standstill (几乎停止发展)"的问题，他们却忽略了一个潜在的市场即他们身边的 "wholesale food and trade(食品批发市场)"。而F 选项首句便举例说明法国、德国、意大利等国家的食品批发产业的市场规模比食品零售产业要大40%。而且在"moreover"后又进一步说明批发的利润大零售很多。因此可以判断此选项是对第一段的例证说明。其中 "for example" 是明显的信息提示词。

\43. 【答案】[D] 
 　  【解析】上段介绍了食品批发商的优势，而D选项第一句"All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which…" 则对上文的内容进行总结，其中all in all 是较明显的信息提示词，即上文中提到的食品批发的优势推出这是明显对于 "big retailers that master the intricacies of wholesaling"是一个"market"。因此D项为正确答案。

\44. 【答案】[G] 
 　  【解析】上段最后一句提出的"particular abilities" 以及"new skills and unfamiliar business models are needed。" , 即零售商需要新的技能及不熟悉的商业模式。而G选项第一句提到的 "these requirements(这些要求)"正是指上文所提到的技能。

\45. 【答案】[A] 
 　  【解析】此题可以用排除法做，所剩下的选项只有A和C，需要注意的是本题并没有明显的信息词，所以需要阅读选项的内容进而找出正确答案。此题前文的已知段落E选项中最后一句"two opposing trends"在A选项中得到了体现，即一方面由于人们选择在外就餐而扩大了食品批发的需求，而另一方面人们又开始感到"anxious(焦虑)"。而C选项第一句提到的"such variations"在上文中并没有得到体现，因此可以断定A为正确答案。

 

 

 

**Part C**

\46. Scinentists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them。

【解析】句子的主干是"scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence"，后接that 引导的同位语从句。If引导的条件状语从句修饰that从句。to the effect that大意是，意思是； fail to 未能； jump to立即，赶快 the rescue营救，援救，解救。

【参考译文】科学家们立即拿出某些明显站不住脚的证据前来救驾，大致说的是如果鸟儿不能控制害虫的话，害虫就会把我们吃掉。

\47. but we have at least drawn near the point of admitting that birds should continue survival as a matter of intrinsic right, regardless of the presence or absence of economic advantage to us。

【解析】句子主干we have drawn near the point。介词短语of admitting that.。.作定语修饰point。其中嵌套了that从句作admit的宾语从句。regardless of.。.作让步状语。a matter of ...。.的问题，大约；draw near 接近，靠近；intrinsic right天生的权利，固有的权利；economic advantage经济利益，经济优势。

【参考译文】但是我们至少已经几乎承认了这样一种观点：不管鸟类对我们是否有经济利益，生存都是它们的固有权利。

\48. Time was when biologists somewhat over worded the evidence that these creatures preserve the health of game by killing the physically weak,or that they prey only on "worthless species。

【解析】主干time was when...。when引导了表语从句。Time was when可看作固定短语，译为"从前，曾经"。注意两个并列同位语从句的翻译。

【参考译文】曾几何时，生物学家总是重述以下的这条证据：这些生物通过捕食弱小的动物去维持生物链的正常运行，或它们只是去捕食"没有价值的物种"。

\49. In Europe, where forestry is ecologically more advanced, the non-commercial tree species are recognized as members of native forest community, to be preserved as such, within reason。

【解析】句子的主体是"the noncommercial tree species are recognized as members of the native forest community"，包含被动语态。句子开头是一个where引导的定语从句，to be preserved是修饰noncommercial tree species的成分。Within reason合情合理的，理智的。注意被动语态的处理。

【参考译文】欧洲的林业从生态上讲较为先进，它把没有成为商业化对象的树种视为原始森林群落的成员而适当地加以保护。

\50. It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are essential to its healthy functioning。

【解析】句子主干"It tends to ignore many elements"；两个that从句意思上转折，句法上为并列的定语从句，修饰the land community。注意插入语、定语从句以及代词指代的处理。

【参考译文】这一体系容易忽视并最终消灭很多缺乏商业价值的物种，然而这些物种对于整个生物群落的健康运行是至关重要的。

参考范文：

The enlightening picture portrays that a hot pot, with numerous ingredients in it, includes such domestic and alien cultures as literature, moral values and performing arts. It seems that the hot pot tastes very delicious because of the rich nutrition of the multi-cultures。

Obviously, the picture characterizes the status quo of Chinese society in which Chinese and Western culture conflict with each other but also merge into a unique form to a certain degree. Since China has opened its door widely to the outside world, many people from different countries have been deeply fascinated by Chinese culture. They will accept and love the Chinese culture as a whole. In addition, Chinese culture should be well shared with foreign people, who have shown their enthusiasm towards China. Meanwhile, the Chinese people are also exposed to foreign cultures when more foreign people come to this oriental country. In this way people from various nations in the world will be able to acquire better understanding of each other and live peacefully in this world。

In my opinion, the culture of any nation is a kind of precious heritage, and belongs to the whole mankind. With economic globalization, the blending of different cultures has become inevitable trend of the time. No country is an isolated island, be it China or the western world. The clearer we grasp the current situation, the more it would be beneficial to the global villagers。

Research on animal intelligence always makes me wonder just how smart humans are.  the fruit-fly experiments described in Carl Zimmer's piece in the Science Times on Tuesday. Fruit flies who were taught to be smarter than the average fruit fly  to live shorter lives. This suggests that  bulbs burn longer, that there is an  in not being too terrifically bright.

Intelligence, it  out, is a high-priced option. It takes more upkeep, burns more fuel and is slow  the starting line because it depends on learning — a gradual  — instead of instinct. Plenty of other species are able to learn, and one of the things they've apparently learned is when to .

Is there an adaptive value to  intelligence? That's the question behind this new research. I like it. Instead of casting a wistful glance  at all the species we've left in the dust I.Q.-wise, it implicitly asks what the real  of our own intelligence might be. This is  the mind of every animal I've ever met.

Research on animal intelligence also makes me wonder what experiments animals would  on humans if they had the chance. Every cat with an owner, , is running a small-scale study in operant conditioning. we believe that  animals ran the labs, they would test us to  the limits of our patience, our faithfulness, our memory for terrain. They would try to decide what intelligence in humans is really , not merely how much of it there is.   , they would hope to study a  question: Are humans actually aware of the world they live in?  the results are inconclusive.

Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. "Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting herd," William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-changing 21st century, even the word "habit" carries a negative implication.

So it seems paradoxical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.

Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habit, we can instead direct our own change by consciously developing new habits. In fact, the more new things we try—the more we step outside our comfort zone—the more inherently creative we become, both in the workplace and in our personal lives.

But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into the hippocampus, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately ingrain into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.

"The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder," says Dawna Markova, author of "The Open Mind" and an executive change consultant for Professional Thinking Partners. "But we are taught instead to 'decide,' just as our president calls himself 'the Decider.' " She adds, however, that "to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other possibilities."

All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she says. Researchers in the late 1960s discovered that humans are born with the capacity to approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally (or collaboratively) and innovatively. At the end of adolescence, however, the brain shuts down half of that capacity, preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable during the first decade or so of life.

The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought. "This breaks the major rule in the American belief system — that anyone can do anything," explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book *This Year I Will...* and Ms. Markova's business partner. "That's a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates excellence." This is where developing new habits comes in.

 

\21.   The Wordsworth’s view, “habits” is claimed by being ________.

A. casual       B. familiar     C. mechanical    D. changeable

\22.   Brain researchers have discovered that the formation of new habits can be ________

A. predicted    B. regulated    C. traced        D. guided

\23.   The word "ruts"( Line 1, Paragraph 4) is closest meaning to ________

A. tracks       B. series       C. characteristics  D. connections

\24.   Dawna Markova would most probably agree that ________.

A. ideas are born of a relaxing mind

B. innovativeness could be taught

C. decisiveness derives from fantastic ideas

D. curiosity activates creative minds

\25.   Ryan's comments suggest that the practice of standardized testing ________

A, prevents new habits form being formed

B, no longer emphasizes commonness

C, maintains the inherent American thinking model

D, complies with the American belief system

It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his paternal (fatherly) wisdom – or at least confirm that he's the kid's dad. All he needs to do is shell our $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore – and another $120 to get the results.

More than 60,000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without prescriptions last years, according to Doug Fog, chief operating officer of Identigene, which makes the over-the-counter kits. More than two dozen companies sell DNA tests Directly to the public , ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to more than $2,500.

Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing , which adopted children can use to find their biological relatives and families can use to track down kids put up for adoption. DNA testing is also the latest rage among passionate genealogists—and supports businesses that offer to search for a family's geographic roots .

Most tests require collecting cells by swabbing saliva in the mouth and sending it to the company for testing.  All tests require a potential candidate with whom to compare DNA.

But some observers are skeptical, "There is a kind of false precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing," says Trey Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors-numbering in the hundreds just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father's line or mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down only from mothers. This DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people also have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-grandparents.

Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don't rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research projects. This means that a DNA database may have a lot of data from some regions and not others, so a person’s test results may differ depending on the company that processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a company uses to estimate relationships may be patented and not subject to peer review or outside evaluation.

\26.   In paragraphs 1 and 2, the text shows PTK's ___________.

[A] easy availability

[B] flexibility in pricing

[C] successful promotion

[D] popularity with households

\27.   PTK is used to __________.

[A] locate one's birth place

[B] promote genetic research

[C] identify parent-child kinship

[D] choose children for adoption

\28.   Skeptical observers believe that ancestry testing fails to__________.

[A] trace distant ancestors

[B] rebuild reliable bloodlines

[C] fully use genetic information

[D] achieve the claimed accuracy

\29.   In the last paragraph, a problem commercial genetic testing faces is __________.

[A] disorganized data collection

[B] overlapping database building

[C] excessive sample comparison

[D] lack of patent evaluation

\30.   An appropriate title for the text is most likely to be__________.

[A] Fors and Againsts of DNA testing

[B] DNA Testing and It's Problems

[C] DNA Testing Outside the Lab

[D] Lies Behind DNA Testing

#### Text 3

The relationship between formal education and economic growth in poor countries is widely misunderstood by economists and politicians alike. Progress in both area is undoubtedly necessary for the social, political and intellectual development of these and all other societies; however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong. We are fortunate that is it, because building new educational systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations. The findings of a research institution have consistently shown that workers in all countries can be trained on the job to achieve radically higher productivity and, as a result, radically higher standards of living.

Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United States. Not long ago, with the country entering a recessing and Japan at its pre-bubble peak. The U.S. workforce was derided as poorly educated and one of the primary cause of the poor U.S. economic performance. Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive-assembly productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda, Nissan, and Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts -- a result of the training that U.S. workers received on the job.

More recently, while examining housing construction, the researchers discovered that illiterate, non-English- speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, consistently met best-practice labor productivity standards despite the complexity of the building industry's work.

What is the real relationship between education and economic development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don't force it. After all, that's how education got started. When our ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder much about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other things.

As education improved, humanity's productivity potential increased as well. When the competitive environment pushed our ancestors to achieve that potential, they could in turn afford more education. This increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by advanced economic performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to escape their poverty traps without political changes that may be possible only with broader formal education. A lack of formal education, however, doesn't constrain the ability of the developing world's workforce to substantially improve productivity for the foreseeable future. On the contrary, constraints on improving productivity explain why education isn't developing more quickly there than it is.

#### Text 4

The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New World are the ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "So much importance attached to intellectual pursuits. " According to many books and articles, New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.

To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church-important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.

The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts church in the decade after 1629,There were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. There men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.

We should not forget , however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While few craftsmen or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions to be analyzed, it is obvious that their views were less fully intellectualized. Their thinking often had a traditional superstitions quality. A tailor named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for leaving England that is filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic frustrations , and religious hope—all came together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his father the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical words: "come out from among them, touch no unclean thing , and I will be your God and you shall be my people." One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he heard in puritan churches.

Meanwhile, many settles had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New world for religion . "Our main end was to catch fish. "

\36.   The author notes that in the seventeenth-century New England___________.

[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life.

[B] intellectual interests were encouraged.

[C] Politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors.

[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment.

Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British social philosopher Herbert Spencer put forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. Spencer argued that all worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing toward perfection. 41.____________.

American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of cultural evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan, along with Tylor, was one of the founders of modern anthropology. In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed together in the evolution of societies.42._____________.

In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism. Historical particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to anthropology. 43._____________.

Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary stage or type of culture. 44._______________.

Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in American anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. But a number of anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of culture in favor of diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural achievement to the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to diffusionists, then spread to other cultures. 45.________________.

Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist Émile Durkheim developed a theory of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the function of society and culture—known as functionalism—became a major theme in European, and especially British, anthropology.

[A]   Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism.

[B]   In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, Boas became skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of human biology and anatomy.

[C]   He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the "survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be replaced by stronger, more advanced races and societies.

[D]   They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance into adulthood.

[E]   Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved.

[F]   Supporters of the theory viewed as a collection of integrated parts that work together to keep a society functioning.

[G]   For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many parts of the world.

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written carefully on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (10 points)

There is a marked difference between the education which everyone gets from living with others, and the deliberate educating of the young. In the former case the education is incidental; it is natural and important, but it is not the express reason of the association. (46) It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience; but this effect is not a part of its original motive. Religious associations began, for example, in the desire to secure the favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil influences; family life in the desire to gratify appetites and secure family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, because of enslavement to others, etc. (47) Only gradually was the by-product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution. Even today, in our industrial life, apart from certain values of industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and emotional reaction of the forms of human association under which the world's work is carried on receives little attention as compared with physical output.

But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an immediate human fact, gains in importance. (48) While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. The need of training is too evident; the pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. (49) Since our chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help considering whether or no we are forming the powers which will secure this ability. If humanity has made some headway in realizing that the ultimate value of every institution is its distinctively human effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned largely through dealings with the young.

(50) We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational process which we have been so far considering, a more formal kind of education -- that of direct tuition or schooling. In undeveloped social groups, we find very little formal teaching and training. These groups mainly rely for instilling needed dispositions into the young upon the same sort of association which keeps the adults loyal to their group.

# **2009****年全国硕士研究生入学统一考试答案详解**

**Section I: Use of English (10 points)**

# 1.【答案】[B]

# 【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查动词词义，Suppose假设， Observe观察， Imagine想象，Consider 考虑，后面的宾语是“ the fruit-fly experiments described in Carl Zimmer in the Science Times”，即“”，后面接着说了实验的结果及其含义。将四个选项代入文中，最符合符合语境的就是Consider考虑，这句话的意思是“让我们考虑考虑卡尔·齐默发表在《科学时代》杂志上的文章所描述的果蝇试验”。 

# 2. 【答案】[A] 

# 　 【解析】惯用衔接题。本题考查动词短语， tend to 表示“有 … 倾向，往往 … ”， fear to表示“唯恐 …  ”，happen to表示“碰巧…”， be threatened to 表示“被恐吓 … ”。文中表示比较聪明的果蝇往往比普通果蝇寿命较短，填tend to符合题意，这句话的意思是“受到训练的果蝇要比普通果蝇聪明，但寿命往往比普通果蝇短”。 

# 3. 【答案】[D] 

# 【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查形容词， lighter 更轻的， thinner 更瘦的， stabler 更稳定的， dimmer 比较暗淡的。本句是前一句推出的结论，即由“果蝇越聪明寿命越短” 推出 “灯泡越暗使用时间越长”，故选D符合题意。lighter，thinner，stabler 一般不用于修饰bulb（灯泡）。这句话的意思是“这表明暗淡的灯泡使用时间会更长”。 

# 4. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】逻辑推理题。  本题考查逻辑关系和词义辨析，tendency 倾向， advantage 优势， inclination 倾向， priority 优先权。由前半句 “bulbs burn longer” (灯泡越暗使用时间越长)推出“这是不特别亮的灯泡的一个优点”，因此advantage最符合题意。这句话的意思是“同时也表明不那么明亮其实是灯泡的一个优势”。 

# 5. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查动词短语， turns out 证明是，结果是， insist on 坚持， sum up 总结， put forward 提出。根据第一段的内容，Fruit flies who were taught to be smarter than the average fruit fly tend to live shorter lives. This suggests that dimmer bulbs burn longer, that there is an advantage in not being too bright. 即果蝇越聪明寿命越短，灯泡越暗淡使用时间越长，可以证明智力是要付出代价的，因此turn out符合这儿的意思。这句话的意思是“事实证明，智力是要付出昂贵的代价的”。  

# 6. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】逻辑衔接题。本题考查介词，off 表示“离开”，behind表示“在…之后”，over表示“在…之上”，along表示“沿着…”。根据上下文可知，这儿表示离开起点时，off比较合适。而along是沿着，沿着起点意思上说不过去，故只能选off。这句话的意思是“它需要更高的给养、消耗更多的燃料，离开起点时速度比较缓慢”。  

# 7. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】词义辨析题。  本题考查形容词。incredible 难以置信的， spontaneous 自发的， inevitable 不可避免的， gradual 渐进的。根据文中的意思，智力取决于学习，而学习是一个渐进的过程，所以选 gradual。这句话的意思是“这是因为智力依靠的是学习（一个循序渐进的过程）而不是一种本能”。 

# 8. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】逻辑推理题。本文的主旨是智力需要昂贵的代价。大量的物种会学习，但它们首先学会的是知道什么时候停止学习，与上文的例子灯泡呼应。四个选项中， fight 斗争， doubt 怀疑，stop 停止，think 思考，正确答案为 C。这句话的意思是“许多其他的物种也有学习的能力，很显然他们学到的东西之一就是知道何时停止”。 

# 9. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】语义搭配题。本题考查形容词，修饰 intelligence 。 invisible 看不见的， indefinite 不确定的，这两个选项意思不符合，可以首先排除。 different 不同的， limited 有限的，都可以与intelligence搭配，但是，通读上下文，会发现这里要强调的并不是不同的物种智力不同，而是所有物种的智力都是有限的，所以 limited 符合文意。这句话的意思是“有限的智力是否有适应值呢？” 

# 10. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】固定搭配题。本题考查固定搭配，cast a glance backward 意思为“回顾”。其他选项：upward 向上，forward向前，afterward后来，都不能与之搭配。这句话的意思是“不是去回顾那些智商远远落后于我们的那些物种”。 

# 11. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查名词，feature 特征， influence 影响， result 结果， cost 代价。根据前文可以知道，聪明是有代价的：比如果蝇越聪明寿命越短，因而 cost “代价”与文

# 中“事实证明，智力是要付出代价”相呼应, 符合文章主旨。这句话的意思是“它（这个研究）含蓄地问我们自己智力的真正代价是什么。” 

# 12. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】惯用搭配题。本题考查介词，on the mind of sb.表示“挂在某人心上，使某人担心”， by the mind “通过思考”， across 常用于come across one’s mind短语中，表示“忽然想到”outside 不与 mind 的搭配。 前面一句说到人们问自己智力真正的代价是什么的问题，这一句紧接上文，说这个问题也是我们所遇到的每个动物所关心的问题，也就是每个动物都挂在心上的，因此on the mind of every animal符合题意。这句话的意思是“我们见过的每种动物都有这种想法”。  

# 13. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】惯用搭配题。本题考查动词，与之搭配的宾语是 experiments ，选项中只有perform 能与 experiments 搭配，表示“做实验”。 deliver 递送， carry 运送， apply 应用，都不与experiment搭配。这句话的意思是“如果动物有机会的话，他们会对人类作什么样的实验”。   

# 14.【答案】[D] 

【解析】逻辑衔接题。本题考查介词短语，属逻辑衔接题。前一句提到 experiments ，本句提到一个具体的实验，所以选 for instance 例如，表示举例说明。 其他短语意思：by chance 偶然， in contrast 相反，as usual 像往常一样。这句话的意思是“比如说，每只有主人的猫都在进行一个小型的操作性条件反射研究”。 

# 15.【答案】[A] 

【解析】逻辑衔接题。本题考查连词，由后半句中 they would test us to 可推测本句使用了虚拟语气，选项中 if 可以引导虚拟条件句。 unless 除非， as 正如， lest 唯恐。这句话的意思是“如果动物进行试验”。 

#  16.【答案】[C] 

【解析】语义推理题。本题考查动词，所填动词应表明实验的目的，并且所填动词的宾语是 limits of our patience, our faithfulness, our memory for terrain ，选项中“ determine 确定”符合题意，并与下文的 decide 相呼应。 moderate 减轻，缓和， overcome 克服， reach 达到。本句的意思是“他们会测定我们的忍耐度，忠诚度，以及对地形的记忆力”。 

# 17. 【答案】[B] 

# 【解析】介词辨析题。本题考查介词，四个选项中 for 表示目的，这个句子的正常句序是 intelligence in humans is really for what，即人类智力的真正用处是什么。at 在，于；after在…之后； with同…一起。这句话的意思是“他们会试图判定人类智力的真正用处是什么”。 

# 18.【答案】[A] 

【解析】逻辑推理题。本题考查逻辑关系。这个句子位于段末，显然起到总结性的作用。四个选项中， Above all 最重要， After all 毕竟， However 然而， Otherwise 否则。根据上下文，本句意思应该是“最重要的是，他们希望研究一个最基本的问题”，故选 Above all 。  

# 19.【答案】[A] 

【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查形容词，修饰 question 。 fundamental 基本的， comprehensive 全面的， equivalent 相等的， hostile 敌对的。由句后问题的内容Are humans actually aware of the world they live in（人类是否真正意识到了自己所生存的世界），可推出这是一个最基本和重要的问题，所以选 fundamental。本句的意思是“他们希望研究一个最基本的问题”。  

# 20.【答案】[C] 

【解析】逻辑衔接与词义辨析题。本题考查副词。空前说“想研究这个问题”，空后说“结果还不确定”。四个选项中， By accident “偶然”， In time “及时”， So far “到目前为止”， Better still “更好的是”，只有 So far 符合语意。这句话的意思是“对此，目前仍无定论”。

# **Section II Reading Comprehension** **Part A**  **Text 1** 

# 参考译文： 习惯是件非常奇妙的事。我们的习惯在无意识的状态下就能行成，习惯使我们的头脑处于自动导航状态，并且放松地进入一种无意识的惯性的舒适之中。威廉·华兹华斯早在19世纪就说过：“不是选择而是习惯主宰着不会思考的兽群。”在日新月异的21世纪，甚至连“习惯”这个词都散发着消极的含义。 

# 因此，在谈论创造力和革新的背景下讨论习惯问题，似乎有点自相矛盾。但是脑科研究人员已经发现，当我们有意识地培养新习惯时，大脑内就会生成平行路径，甚至全新的脑细胞，这些脑细胞能将我们的思维导向全新的、富有创意的轨道。 

# 与其认为我们固有的习惯不可更改，不如通过有意识地培养新习惯以做出改变。事实上，我们尝试的新事物越多，也就是说，我们越远离自己的舒适范围，不论在职场上还是在个人生活上，我们就越具有创造性。 

# 但是，我们也不必费心地去摈弃旧有的习惯；一旦形成思维定式，它们就将永久地被储存在大脑。相反，我们刻意培养的新习惯能生成平行思维路径，这些思维路径会避开那些旧有的路径。 

# 《开放的心灵》一书的作者朵娜·马可瓦说：“创新的首要条件就是酷爱非凡的事物。但我们接受的教育不是要求我们热爱非凡事物而是要求我们‘做出决定’，正如我们的老板称自己是‘决策者’一样。”然而，她补充说道：“决策意味着保留一种可能而摈弃所有其他的可能。一名出色的创新思想者总是试图探索很多其他的可能性选择。” 

# 她说，我们所有的人都是以自己没有觉察到的方法来解决问题的。20世纪60年代晚期，研究者们发现,人类天生就能以四种主要的方法来解决面临的挑战。这四种方法是：分析法、程序法、相关法（又称相互协作法）和革新法。然而，在青春期就要结束时，大脑就关闭了其中的两种功能，只保留了在生命最初的十几年里看起来似乎最有价值的思维方法。 

# 现在，人们强调标准测试，这实际上突出了分析和程式，意味着很少有人天生就使用创新和相互协作的思维模式。M.J.·赖安是2006年出版的《今年我打算…》一书的作者，也是马可瓦女士的生意伙伴，她说：“这有悖于美国信仰体系的主要信仰，即每个人都无所不能。这是我们长久以来编造的一个谎言，这个谎言造就了平庸。了解自己擅长什么并且在此方面更加努力就能走向卓越。”这才正是培养新习惯的开端。

21．【答案】[C] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为： 华兹华斯认为,习惯的特点就是 

本题问的是Wordsworth对habit的观点，根据人名定位到第一段，“Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting herd,” William Wordsworth said in the 19th century（威廉•华兹华斯早在19世纪就说过：“不是选择而是习惯主宰着不会思考的兽群”）。选项[C] mechanical (机械的)可以说是对unreflecting的替换。此外文章第二句中提到 We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine（我们的习惯在无意识的状态下就能行成，习惯使我们的头脑处于自动导航状态，并且放松地进入一种无意识的惯性的舒适之中），从这个表述中可以看出习惯的形成过程完全是一种无意状态下的机械活动。因此，正确选项为[C]。[A] casual不经意的，[B] familiar熟悉的， [D] changeable可变化的。

\22. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为：脑研究者发现，习惯的形成可以被 

# 我们定位到第二段So it seems antithetical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel synaptic paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks. （因此，在谈论创造力和革新的背景下讨论习惯问题，似乎有点自相矛盾。但是脑科研究人员已经发现，当我们有意识地培养新习惯时，大脑内就会生成平行路径，甚至全新的脑细胞，这些脑细胞能将我们的思维导向全新的、富有创意的轨道。）第一句说creativity 和innovation 与habit是互不相容的，接着文章用but表示转折，在这种情况下我们可以推测后面的内容是讲creativity 和innovation与habit是相容的，研究者发现了什么呢？当我们有意识地(consciously)形成新的习惯时，我们甚至能够创造全新的脑细胞，这能够将我们的思绪导向全新的、富有创意的轨道。由此可见研究人员认为习惯的形成是可以被引导的。故[D]guided引导的是正确选项。[A] predicted预见的，[B] regulated管理的，[C] traced 追踪的。

\23. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】 词义推断题。意为：“ruts”这个词在意思上最贴近于 

解析：本题为词义推断题，必须从上下文中加以理解，But don’t bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into the hippocampus, they’re there to stay. 

Instead, the new habits we deliberately ingrain into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads（但是，我们也不必费心地去摈弃旧有的习惯；一旦形成思维定式，它们就将永久地被储存在大脑的海马区。相反，我们刻意培养的新习惯能生成平行思维路径将，这些思维路径会避开那些旧有的路径），首先我们由they’re there to stay，知道ruts是一个具体的东西，接着由the new habits create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.我们可以知道ruts与pathways和roads应该是同义替换的，由此选择[A]tracks痕迹，轨迹。[B]series系列，[C]characteristics特点，[D]connections联系。  

\24. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为：朵娜•马可瓦最可能同意 

根据人名Dawna Markova我们可以定位到最第5段，由“The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder,” says Dawna Markova（Markova说认为创新最需要的就是对非凡事情的着迷），因此选[D]curiosity activates creative minds。而 [A] ideas are born of a relaxing mind观点来源于放松的头脑，是利用文中出现的relaxing加以编制的选项，文中没有对应的句子[B] innovative- ness could be taught创新能够被传授，虽然文中最后一段Knowing what you’re good at and doing even more of it creates excellence.” This is where developing new habits comes in（了解自己擅长什么并且在此方面更加努力就能走向卓越。”这才正是培养新习惯的开端），但只是说doing even more of it creates excellence.并没有交代是本人自觉地多做，还是被“taught”地多做。[C] decisiveness derives from fantastic ideas果断来自于奇特的想法，文中没有关于果断的信息。 

\25. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为：赖安的评论意味着标准化测试 

# 本题难度较大，可以通过排除法做出选择。我们首先找到文中关于标准化测试的描述The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought.大意为目前标准化测试只强调了analysis与procedure，这从根本上使得很少有人能够使用 innovative与collaborative的思维模式，而前面一段提到，人天生的思维模式包含四种，因此[C] maintains the inherent American thinking model坚持天生的美国思维模式 不正确；接着我们找到Ryan的评论，This breaks the major rule in the American belief system — that anyone can do anything. That’s a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you’re good at and doing even more of it creates excellence. 由第一句，“这有悖于美国信仰体系的主要信仰，即每个人都无所不能，”我们可以判断 [D] complies with the American belief system与美国的信仰体系一致 这个选项不正确；第二句“这是我们长久以来编造的一个谎言，这个谎言造就了平庸”，可以断定[B] no longer emphasizes commonness不再强调平庸 也不正确；只剩下[A] prevents new habits from being formed阻止了新习惯的形成。那么从文中哪地方可以判断[A]正确呢。请看Ryan评论的最后一句话，“了解自己擅长什么并且在此方面更加努力就能走向卓越”以及文章最后一句话，This is where developing new habits comes in. 这才正是培养新习惯的开端。这句话紧跟在Ryan的评论之后，是对其评论的总结和意义所在。因此[A]项正确。

# **Text 2**

节选自2008年11月14日的《科学美国人》题目为Who's Your Daddy? The Answer May Be at the Drugstore.（谁是你父亲？答案或许就在药店）。这是一篇科普类文章，介绍了在美国基因检测血缘关系的技术的普及以及其局限性和问题。

参考译文：

了解自己的孩子的父亲是明智的父亲，但现在人们可以提升自己作为父亲的智慧---或者至少证实自己是孩子的爸爸。他只需付30美元即可在当地的药店买一套亲子关系鉴定包（PTK）-- 另外再付120美元就可得到鉴定结果。 

身份基因公司是一家生产不需处方可以直接出售的PTK的公司。该公司的首席运营官达格佛格说，自从去年不需要处方即购可买之后，己经超过 6 万人购买了 PTK。有二十多家公司直接向公众出售DNA鉴定，价格从几百美元到2500美元不等。 

其中最受欢迎的是父子血缘鉴定。被收养的孩子可以通过它来找到与自己具有血缘关系的亲属，收养孩子的家庭也可以通过它来了解收养孩子的情况。DNA鉴定最近也引起了谱系学者的强烈愤怒，因为它支持提供寻找家族的祖籍服务的生意。 

大部分的鉴定需要通过从口中拭取唾液来收集细胞，然后送往公司进行检测。所有的这些检测都需要有一个潜在的候选人以便与他的DNA进行比对。 

但是有些观察者对此持怀疑态度。纽约大学的社会学家特洛伊•达斯特说：“那些正在做祖先鉴定的人们所宣扬的祖先鉴定的精确度其实是错的。”他注意到，每个人都有很多的祖先---往前推几百年就可以找到成百的祖先。然而，大多数祖先鉴定只考虑一个世系，或者是通过男子继承的父亲方面的Y染色体，或者是从母亲一方遗传下来的线粒体DNA。这种DNA只能显示约一到两个祖先的基因信息，即使还会有六个其他的曾祖父母或者有14个其他的曾曾祖父母，假如我们仅往前推三代或者四代的话。 

批评家还认为，商业基因鉴定实际上只相当于拿样本进行比对的参考信息。有些公司使用的数据库并不依赖于系统的数据收集而是把不同研究机构收集的信息合在一起。这就意味着处理数据的公司不同，所用 DNA 数据库也会不同。另外，一个公司用来鉴定血缘关系的计算机程序可能是受到专利保护的，不能受制于同行的评论和外部的评价。  

 

\26. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】推理判断题。 意为：文章第一、二段表明了PTK 的  

文章首段最后一句话All he needs to do is shell out $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore – and another $120 to get the results（只需花 30 美元在地方药房作亲子鉴定-- 另外再付120美元就可得到鉴定结果）， 第二段第一句More than 60,000people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without prescriptions last year（自从去年不需要处方即购可买之后，己经超过 6 万人购买了 PTK ）。可以知道文章第一、二段主要说明了PTK很容易买到，因此选项[A] easy availability容易得到 为正确答案。从第二段整段我们可以看出，关于鉴定价格浮动只在第二段最后一句有所体现，因而[B] flexibility in pricing灵活的价格 不能算一、二段的大意；[C]successful promotion成功促销 文中未提到；[D]popularity with households受家庭欢迎 属过度推断。  

\27. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】事实细节题。 意为： PTK 是用来 

从文中第三段Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing, which adopted children can use to find their biological relatives（被收养的孩子可以通过亲子鉴定找到他具有血缘关系的亲属），这个意思同[C] identify parent-child kinship鉴定亲子关系 的表述是一致的。[A] locate one’s birth place寻找一个人的出生地 这个选项比较具有迷惑性，从第三段最后一句话DNA testing is also the latest rage among passionate genealogists --- and supports businesses that offer to search for a family’s geographic roots （PTK 最近惹怒了很多谱系学家，它支持提供寻找家族的祖籍服务的生意），.我们可以看出， PTK 没有主要被用来寻找一个人的出生地，因而排除；选项[B] promote genetic research促进基因研究，[D] choose children for adoption选择收养的孩子 文中均未提及。  

\28. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为：持怀疑态度的观察者认为祖先鉴定没有 

从题干信息我们可以将它定位到文中第五段第一句There is a kind of false precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing（那些正在做祖先鉴定的人们所宣扬的（祖先鉴定）精确度其实是错的），这句话是对这一段的概括，因此[D]achieve the claimed accuracy达到声称的准确性 符合上述意思。而[A]trace distant ancestors找寻遥远的祖先，[B] rebuild reliable bloodlines重建可靠的血缘关系，[C] fully use genetic information充分利用基因信息 都只是它的细节之一，不能作为概括表述。 

\29. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为：最后一段中商业基因鉴定面临的一个问题是 

从最后一段第二句Databases used by some companies don’t rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research projects. This means that a DNA database may differ depending on the company that processes the results（一些公司使用的数据库并不依赖于系统的数据收集而是把不同研究机构收集的信息合在一起。这就意味着处理数据的公司不同，所用 DNA 数据库也会不同），可以断定[A]disorganized data collection数椐收集的紊乱 与本句话意思基本一致，为正确答案。文中并未提及数据是否重合，[B] overlapping database building 重合的数据库建设 无根椐。[C] excessive sample comparison 过多的样本比对 [D] lack of patent evaluation 缺少专利评价 文中没有体现。  

\30. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】主旨大意题。 意为：本文最合适的题目应是 

本题考察对文章主旨的把握，通读全文，我们看不到有明显赞成 DNA 测试的倾向，因此[A] Fors and Againsts of DNA Testing  DNA 测试的赞成与反对 不能概括文章大意；同样，文中没有特别强调实验室内外的问题，因而也可排除[C] DNA Testing Outside the Lab  实验室外的DNA测试；文中作者只是客观地提出了 DNA 测试存在的不准确性问题，但并没有指明是哪些人的谎言，因而[D] Lies Behind DNA Testing  DNA 测试背后的谎言 也不能算对；文章首先说到了PTK很容易得到，亲子血缘鉴定最受欢迎，接着说明了持怀疑态度的人们的看法，虚假的精确性与数据库的紊乱。因此[B] DNA Testing and Its Problems  DNA 测试及它存在的问题 最能概括文章的大意，是文章最合适的题目。

节选自2003年12月Mckinsey Quarterly 《麦肯锡季刊》原文题目为Educating Global Workers(全球工人的教育)。文章驳斥了一般认为发展教育可以带来经济增长的观点，指出持续的经济发展可以促进教育的发展，但缺少正规教育并不会限制发展中世界工人为可预见的将来大幅度提高生产力的能力。  

参考译文： 

正规教育和经济发展的关系在贫困国家普遍遭到经济学家和政治家的误解。毫无疑问，教育和经济的进步对于这些贫困国家以及其他所有国家的社会、政治和智力发展都是必不可少的；但是，认为在贫困国家极应优先发展教育以促进经济的快速发展的传统观点是错误的。我们很幸运这种看法是错误的，这是因为，在贫困国家建立新的教育制度并且让足够多的人们接受教育从而促进经济绩效需要两到三代人的努力。一个研究机构的发现一直在向我们表明，所有国家的工人都可以通过在岗培训极大地提高生产力，从而极大地提高人们的生活水准。 

具有讽刺意味的是，这种观点的第一个证据是在美国出现的。不久前，美国进入经济萧条，而日本处于泡沫前的经济发展高峰，人们认为之所以如此，是由于美国工人教育程度低，从而造成了美国较差的经济发展。在汽车生产方面，日本过去是而且现在仍保持全球领先地位。但是研究表明，工人在接受岗上培训后，美国的本田、尼桑和丰田汽车生产厂家达到了日本同类汽车生产厂家大约95%的生产率。 

​    还有一个更近的证据。在对住宅建设的检查中，研究人员发现，虽然建筑行业的工作极其复杂，但是在休斯敦和得克萨斯两地的墨西哥建筑工人，尽管没有文化，不会说英语却始终能达到最优劳动生产率标准。 

教育和经济发展的真正关系是什么呢？我们不得不相信，持续的经济发展可以促进教育的发展，即使政府不施加压力。毕竟，这才是教育开始的方式。一万年前，当我们的祖先依靠狩猎和采集生活时，他们没有时间思考找寻食物之外的任何事情。只有在他们以一种更加高产的方式获得食物之后，才有从事其他事情的时间。 

随着教育的发展，人类的生产潜力也得到提高。只有当竞争性环境促使我们的祖先达到他们的生产潜力时，他们才能反过来负担得起教育。高层次教育的不断发展或许是先进的经济绩效所要求的复杂政治制度的必要但不是充分条件。因此，假如没有那些只有在有了更广泛的正规教育之后才可能发生的政治变化，贫困国家或许就不能够逃脱它们贫困的命运。然而，缺少正规教育并不会限制发展中世界工人为可预见的将来大幅度提高生产力的能力。相反，对提高生产力的限制解释了发展中国家的教育为什么没有比实际发展得更加迅速。  

 

\31. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】推理判断题目。意为：在第一段作者认为在贫困国家教育的重要性 

作者在首段指出however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong（但是，传统的观点认为在贫困国家对促进经济的快速发展而言，教育是极应优先考虑的要素之一，这是种错误的看法），教育的优先性和教育的重要性实际上是一个意思，而既然文中说优先教育是种错误的看法，由此可推出教育的重要性被过度的重视了即被高估了，因此 [D] has been overestimated 被高估 正确。[A] is subject to groundless doubts 受到无根据的怀疑 不正确；[B] has fallen victim of bias 成为偏见的牺牲品 [C] is conventionally downgraded 被降低 表述的意思文中没有提及。 

\32. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为：第一段表明建立新的教育体系________。  

在第一段作者主要谈论了靠优先发展教育来促进经济发展是错误的看法，而世界各国的工人经过了劳动培训可以获取高生产率进而带来更高的生活水平。解答细节题时同样明显背离中心的选项可首先排除，即先可排除[A] challenges economists and politicians 挑战经济学家和政治家，和[C] demands priority from the government 要求政府重视；依据第一段的倒数第二句because building new educational systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations（通过教育体系来使足够多的人能提高经济能力将需要两三代人），由此可知建立教育体系在当前是不可能，而这种建立需要几代人的努力才能实现，故[B] takes efforts of generations 需要几代人的努力 是正确的；[D] requires sufficient labor force 需要充足的劳动力 第一段没有提及。 

\33. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为：日本和美国劳动力的主要区别是什么。 

解答本题可用运排除法。依据文章的第二段，美国劳动力受教育程度差遭到嘲笑并被认为是其经济表现差的原因之一。美国工人接受了职业培训后，本田、丰田的美国公司才达到了日本 95 ％的产量，由此可知日本工人的生产力比美国工人的生产力高。从文中可知，美国劳动力受教育程度差是个事实也是美国经济表现差的重要原因，由此可排除不符合文意的 [C] the U.S workforce has a better education 美国工人教育程度高；而[A] the Japanese workforce is better disciplined 日本工人纪律更严 [D] the U.S workforce is more organized 美国工人组织较好 在文中未提及；由此可得出只有[B] the Japanese workforce is more productive日本的劳动力更多产 正确，而依据文意，既然日本保持了汽车产量的全球领先地位，自然日本的劳动力比美国的劳力更多产也验证了[B]为正确答案。  

\34. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】推理判断题。意为：作者引用了我们祖先的例子来表明教育出现在 

本题有很大的迷惑性。很多考生选择了[A] when people had enough time 当人们有了充裕的时间时，因为最后一句话明确指出：只有当人们有了更高产的获得食物的方式时，人们才有时间做其它事情。但是本选项只是表面现象，而没有指出教育产生的实质。依据文章倒数第二段的最后两句可知，作者举出了我们祖先的例子是来论证本段第二和第三句话的内容We have begun to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don’t force it. After all, that’s howeducation got started（我们不得不相信，持续的经济发展可以促进教育的发展，即使政府不施加压力。毕竟，这才是教育开始的方式）， 即教育与经济发展的真正关系：持续的经济发展可以促进教育的发展。因此我们选择[C] when people no longer went hungry在解决了温饱的情况下才可以谈教育。虽然例子中谈到了时间，但没有时间是什么造成的呢？是需要花时间去找猎物来填饱肚子而没了受教育的时间，只有是否饿肚子和经济发展逻辑上相关。[B] prior to better ways of finding food 找到更好的获得食物的方法之前 [D] as a result of pressure on government 由于政府的压力  文中没有提及。 

\35. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】主旨大意题。意为：根据文章的最后一段我们可以得知，教育的发展 

解析：文章在最后一段针对上文讨论的教育和生产的关系做出了总结。在本段作者明确指出缺乏正规的教育并不能限制发展极大提高产量的世界劳动力，而反之，对提高产量的限制得以解释了为什么教育发展得没有那么快。由此可见，提高产量优先于发展教育，故[C] follows improved productivity 紧随生产力的提高  为正确答案；而[A] results directly from competitive environments 直接源于竞争性环境 [D] cannot afford political changes 无法负担政治变化 表达不符合文章的中心；[B] does not depend on economic performance 不取决于经济绩效  意思和文意相反。 

 

**Text 4**

摘自1989年出版的Intellectual Life in America: A History（《美国知识生活的历史》）一书，是一篇关于美国早期历史的文章，讲述美国历史中的清教徒传统，及早期移民的复杂动机和背景。 

参考译文：   

新大陆历史上被研究最彻底的知识分子就是17世纪新英格兰的牧师和政治领袖。美国哲学的权威历史表明，在殖民时期的美洲，没有一个地方像新英格兰那样“重视知识的追求”。按照很多书和文章的说法，新英格兰的领袖们确立了美国知识分子生活中的基本主题和当务之急，那就是不断演变占支配地位的清教传统。 

采用这个方式了解新英格兰通常意味着首先考察清教徒的神学改革和关于教会的独特思想——这也是我们不能忽视的重要话题。但是与对南方知识分子生活的考察相一致，我们可以把最初的清教徒看作是欧洲文化的载体，这种文化逐渐适应了新大陆的环境。新英格兰殖民地是追求广泛理解的理想诸如文明礼貌和艺术鉴赏力等的重大事件的发生地。 

马萨诸塞海湾的早期定居者中包括在英国受到过良好教育和非常有影响的人物。在1629年之后的十年里，除了来到马萨诸塞教会的90个左右的有学问的牧师，还有像约翰温思罗普这样的政治领袖。温思罗普是一个有教养的绅士，还是一个律师，在他来到波士顿之前，曾经是英国皇室的官员。这些人写作并出版了大量的作品。为新大陆和欧洲大陆的读者所阅读，使新英格兰呈现出一派严肃的知识氛围。 

然而，我们不应该忘记，大多数新英格兰人并没有受过良好的教育。虽然几乎没有什么工匠或农民，更不要说受赡养者和仆人，留下文学作品后人分析，但是非常明显，他们的观点尚未充分理性化。他们的思维常常包含传统的迷信的性质。有一个叫约翰丹的裁缝，他在17世纪30年代后期移民到新英格兰，留下了一份描述自己离开英国的原因的作品，里面充满了许多符号。性别混乱、经济挫折和宗教希望 – 在他打开圣经的决定性时刻都一起涌来，他告诉父亲他看到的第一行将决定他的命运，他独到了那些不可思议的文字：“你们务要从他们中间出来，不要沾不洁净的物，我要做你们的父，你们要做我的儿女。”人们不仅会想，丹对这些他在清教教堂里所听到的解释圣经的布道会有什么想法呢。 

同时，很多的定居者不像丹那样对宗教那样虔诚。有个牧师对此深有感触。在海岸附近，他遇到一些人，这些人对他嘲弄说，他们不是由于宗教才来到新大陆的。“我们的主要目的是捕鱼。”  

 

\36. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】事实细节题目。意为：作者认为在 17 世纪的新英格兰 

第一段主要是讲17世纪的新英格兰重视知识追求，新英格兰的领袖们确立了美国知识生活中清教传统的基本主题和当务之急。从第一段的第二句话nowhere else in colonial America was “so much importance attached to intellectual pursuits” （没有一个地方像新英格兰那样“重视知识的追求”），可以断定[B] intellectual interests were encouraged 知识兴趣受到鼓励 是正确选项；[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life 清教传统支配着政治生活 是对原文New England’s leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life（新英格兰的领袖们确立了美国知识分子生活中的基本主题和当务之急，那就是不断演变占支配地位的清教传统）的篡改；[C] Politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors 政治从知识努力中获益非浅 从原文的表述中无法推出；[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment 知识追求享有自由环境 文章中没有提到“对于知识的追求享有自由的环境”。  

\37. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】推理判断题。意为：第二段中暗示出新英格兰人 

第二段中的第二句提到，But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances（但是与对南方知识分子生活的考察相一致，我们可以把最初的清教徒看作是欧洲文化的载体，这种文化逐渐适应了新大陆的环境）。由 we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture我们可以断定 [B] brought with them the culture of the Old World带来了旧大陆的文化 是正确的选项；选项中的 New Englanders 对应文中的 Puritans, brought with them the culture of the Old World 对应该文章中的 carriers of European culture，故此选项为此句中的同义替换；[A] experienced a comparatively peaceful early history 经历了一个相对和平的早期历史 文中没有提及；[C] paid little attention to southern intellectual life 不注重南方知识生活 与文中in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life（与对南方知识分子生活的考察相一致）意思相反；[D] were obsessed with religious innovations 对宗教革新着迷 表述与第二段第一句话的意思有出入。 

\38. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】事实细节题。意为：早期到达马萨诸赛海湾的牧师和政治领袖 

根据文章第三段最后一句话These men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness（这些人写作并出版了大量的作品。为新大陆和欧洲大陆的读者所阅读，使新英格兰呈现出一派严肃的知识氛围）。与[D] created a new intellectual atmosphere in New England 在新英格兰创造了新的知识氛围 相呼应，为正确选项。[A] were famous in the New World for their writings 在新大陆因他们的作品而出名 选项中 in the new world 缩小了原文所表述的范围，是对最后一句话的片面理解；[B] gained increasing importance in religious affairs 在宗教事务中赢得了越来越大的重要性 文中没有提及；[C] abandoned high positions before coming to the New World 来新大陆之前放弃了很高的地位 这只是Winthrop的例子，不能概括所有的早期牧师和政治领袖。 

\39. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】例证题。意为：关于 John Dane 的故事表明受教育较少的新英格兰人  

文章第四段第三句话their thinking often had a traditional superstitions quality（他们的思维常常包含传统迷信的性质），接下来就举了约翰丹的例子。很显然，据这个例子是为了说明第三句话的观点，因此[A] influenced by superstitions 受迷信的影响 是正确的。[B] troubled with religious beliefs 受到宗教信仰的困扰 [C] puzzled by church sermons 对教堂布道感到困惑 在约翰丹的例子中有所涉及，但不是举例的目的；[D] frustrated with family earnings 对家庭收入感到失望 文中没有提及。 

\40. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】推断题。意为：从文章中可以看出到新英格兰的早期的定居者 

通过全文可看出来到英语兰早期的定居者，有政客、牧师、裁缝还有渔民，由此可见早期的定居者背景多种多样，[C] came from different backgrounds 来自不同的背景 表述的正是这个意思，为正确选项。[A] were mostly engaged in political activities 主要从事政治活动 表述片面；[B] were motivated by an illusory prospect 为虚幻的前景所驱动 文中没有提及；[D] left few formal records for later reference 几乎没有留下可供后人参考的正式记录 与文中表述有出入。   

 

**Part B** 

本篇文章出自MSN网站上的百科全书encarta上的文章，主要讲述了人类文化，以及人类认知自身文化的历史进程。本文是一篇文化类的文章，主要讲的是文化发展过程中的各种关于文化的理论。第一段讲的是 Herbert Spencer 的“生物和文化进化理论”。第二段讲的是 Lewis Henry Morgan 的“文化进化理论”。第三段可以看到， Franz Boas 提出了一种“历史特殊论”，它强调所有文化的唯一性。第四段还是讲了 Franz Boas 的理论。第五段我们除了看到“历史特殊论”外，还看到一种“ 扩散 ”理论和“ 扩散主义者 ”。第六段， Émile Durkheim 提出了一种文化理论，他认为宗教信仰有助于加强社会团结。

参考译文： 

19世纪60年代英国博物学家查尔斯•达尔文提出开创性的生物进化理论，无独有偶，英国社会哲学家赫尔伯特•斯宾塞提出了自己的生物和文化进化理论。斯宾塞认为，世间所有的现象，包括人类社会，随着时间的变化而变化，朝着完美而发展。他认为，人类进化以他称之为“适者生存”的斗争为特征。在这些斗争中，弱小的种族和社会最终必将为更强大、更先进的种族和社会所代替。 

19世纪晚期，美国社会科学家刘易斯•亨利•摩根提出了文化进化的另一理论。摩根与泰勒都是现代人类学的奠基人之一。在其作品中，他企图向人们揭示在社会进化的过程中文化的所有方面是如何共同变化的。因此，摩根认为，诸如家庭结构、婚姻形式，亲属种类、财产所有、政府形式、技术以及食物生产制度等文化的不同方面，都随社会的演变而变化。 

20世纪早期，在北美洲，生于德国的美国人类学家弗朗兹•博厄斯发展了一个全新的文化理论，称为“历史特殊论”。历史特殊论强调所有文化的独特性，为人类学的发展提供了新的方向。另外的人类学家认为，像发明这样的文化革新都有一个起源，从一个社会传到另一个社会。这个理论称为“扩散论”。 

博厄斯认为，任何社会的文化都必须理解为其独特历史的结果，而不是属于更广泛的进化阶段或者文化类型中诸多文化中的一个。为了尽可能彻底地研究具体的不同文化，博厄斯精通语言学即对语言的研究和体质人类学即对人类生物学和解剖学的研究。 

主要是由于博厄斯诸多学生的影响，历史特殊论在美国的人类学研究中成为文化研究的一个重要方法。但20世纪早期的人类学家中也有许多人抵制文化特殊理论，而支持文化扩散理论。有些人把几乎每一个重要的文化进步都归因于少数几个尤其是几个天才民族的发明。按照扩散理论者的观点，这些民族然后再传播到其他文化。比如，基于不充分的信息，英国人类学家格拉弗顿•艾略特和W.J.佩里错误地认为，农业耕作、陶器制作和冶金术都起源于古埃及，然后传播到世界各地。事实上，所有这些文化都是在世界上的不同地方不同时间分别发展起来的。 

法国社会学家埃米尔•迪尔海姆也是在20世纪早期发展了一个将对人类学产生深远影响的文化理论。迪尔海姆提出，宗教信仰的作用就是加强社会的团结。对社会功能与文化之间关系的兴趣—称为文化功能主义—成为欧洲特别是英国人类学的一个重要主题。  

 

选项译文： 

A.另外的人类学家认为，像发明这样的文化革新都有一个起源，从一个社会传到另一个社会。这个理论称为“扩散论”。 

B.为了尽可能彻底地研究具体的不同文化，博厄斯精通语言学即对语言的研究和体质人类学即对人类生物学和解剖学的研究。 

C. 他认为，人类进化以他称之为“适者生存”的斗争为特征。在这些斗争中，弱小的种族和社会最终必将为更强大、更先进的种族和社会所代替。 

D.他们还重视那些重要似乎能保持一个民族的社会结构的仪式，比如正式象征孩子进入成年的成年礼。

E．因此，摩根认为，诸如家庭结构、婚姻形式，亲属种类、财产所有、政府形式、技术以及食物生产制度等文化的不同方面，都随社会的演变而变化。 

F．该理论的支持者把文化看作是共同作用保持社会运转的综合部分的集合。 

G．比如，基于不充分的信息，英国人类学家格拉弗顿•艾略特和W.J.佩里错误地认为，农业耕作、陶器制作和冶金术都起源于古埃及，然后传播到世界各地。事实上，所有这些文化都是在世界上的不同地方不同时间分别发展起来的。

 

\41. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】这个空出现在第一段的末尾，而第一段讲的是 Herbert Spencer 的theory of biological and cultural evolution（生物和文化进化理论），并且提到了 Charles Darwin，Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s（与19世纪60年代英国博物学家查尔斯•达尔文提出开创性的生物进化理论相一致）。我们都知道 Charles Darwin 提出了著名的生物界的适者生存的发展规律。选项 [C] 的意思是，“他认为，人类进化以他称之为‘适者生存’的斗争为特征。在这些斗争中，弱小的种族和社会最终必将为更强大、更先进的种族和社会所代替。”选项[C]说人类社会的进化也有适者生存这一特征，与前面Charles Darwin的适者生存相呼应。空前的那句话说Spencer认为包括人类社会的所有世间现象都是朝着完美的方向在不断变化，加上前面所说的Spencer的生物和文化进化理论与达尔文的生物进化理论相一致，可以确定本题的答案是选项 [C]，其中He argued中的He 显然是指Spencer 。 

\42. 【答案】[E] 

【解析】本题出现在第二段末，肯定意思应该与本段的意思紧密相连。第二段主要讲的是 Lewis Henry Morgan 的theory of cultural evolution （文化进化理论），空前的那句话说，在他的作品里，他尽量说明了 how aspects of culture changed together in the evolution of societies. （文化的诸多方面随社会的演变而变化）。这跟选项 [E] Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved（因此，他认为，诸如家庭结构、婚姻形式，亲属种类、财产所有、政府形式、技术以及食物生产制度等文化的不同方面，都随社会的演变而变化）的内容不谋而合。所以，我们可以断定，本题的答案为选项[E]。 

\43. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】这一题判断起来相对较难。第三段主要介绍了美国人类学家Franz Boas 提出的historical particularism （历史特殊论），强调所有文化的独特性，为人类学的发展提供了新的方向。我们可以推测，最后一句话有可能会是对历史特殊论的进一步解释，或者Boas的其他观点。所以选项[B]有很大的迷惑性；但是，通过对下文的阅读，特别是通过第五段的阅读，我们发现，第五段中将historical particularism和diffusionism（扩散主义）进行了比较，指出历史特殊论之所以流行很大程度上是由于Boas诸多学生的影响；然而也有一些人类学家拒绝历史特殊论而对扩散论情有独钟。而在此之前，没有地方提到过扩散主义，以及这一理论是由谁提出的。所以我们可以推测，第三段有可能是介绍人类学的historical particularism 和，填空的地方就可能是对另一种新观点即diffusionism的介绍。选项[A] 刚好介绍了什么叫diffusionism ，Other anthropologists believed thatcultural innovations, such as inventions, had a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism（另外的人类学家认为，像发明这样的文化革新都有一个起源，从一个社会传到另一个社会。这个理论称为扩散论）, 而且other anthropologists 与前文North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas相呼应。由此可以断定，本题正确选项为[A]. 

\44. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】第四段继续介绍Franz Boas理论，他认为，任何社会的文化都必须理解为其独特历史的结果，而不是属于更广泛的进化阶段或者文化类型中诸多文化中的一个。很显然，本段是对historical particularism进一步阐述。选项[B] In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, Boas became skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of human biology and anatomy.（为了尽可能彻底地研究具体的不同文化，博厄斯精通语言学即对语言的研究和体质人类学即对人类生物学和解剖学的研究。），里面既提到Boas，又提到了解特殊的文化（particular cultures 是关键词），符合本段的意思。因此，本题正确选项为[B]。 

\45. 【答案】[G] 

【解析】第五段对“历史特殊论”和“扩散理论”进行了比较说明，指出“历史特殊论”方法的盛行是由于Boas学生的影响，而“扩散理论”认为，重要的文化进步归因于少数几个天才民族的发明，而这些民族然后再传播到其他文化。选项 [G] For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many parts of the world. （比如，基于不充分的信息，英国人类学家格拉弗顿•艾略特和W.J.佩里错误地认为，农业耕作、陶器制作和冶金术都起源于古埃及，然后传播到世界各地。事实上，所有这些文化都是在世界上的不同地方不同时间分别发展起来的。）很显然，这是一个例子，通过分析这个例子，我们可以知道，这是两种不同的观点的比较。显然是用来补充说明前面的观点的，即“历史特殊论（historical particularism）”和“扩散理论（diffusionism） 理论的对比。所以，本题的答案就是选项[G]。

本篇文章节选自John Dewey的专著Democracy and Education（《民主与教育》），是一篇典型的学术论说型文体，讨论的是正规教育的地位。文章首先指出从与他人共处中获得的教育和对年轻人进行的有意教育之间存在显著差异；进而指出，在对待年轻人的问题上，交往本身正在变得越来越重要；最后指出，在不发达的社会群体中几乎没有正规教育和培训，他们主要通过人与人之间的交往来向年轻人灌输需要的性格。 

本篇文章节选自John Dewey的专著Democracy and Education（《民主与教育》），是一篇典型的学术论说型文体，讨论的是The Place of Formal Education.（正规教育的地位）。 

 

参考译文： 

从与他人共处中获得的教育和对年轻人进行的有意教育之间存在显著差异。在前一种情况，加以是偶然发生的；这种教育是自然的也是重要的，但不是这种关系的直接原因。46、可以说，任何社会制度的价值在于它对扩大和改进经验方面的影响，但是这种影响并不是它原来的动机的一部分。比如，宗教交往始于得到反对势力支持的愿望和避开邪恶势力的愿望；家庭生活始于满足食欲和保护家庭永久的愿望；系统劳动，很大程度上是由于被他人奴役，等等。47、一种制度的副产品，只是逐步被注意到的，而这种效果被视为实施这种制度的一个指导性因素更加缓慢。即使今天，在我们的工业社会中，除勤恳和节俭等价值外，对使工作得以进行的人类交往形式的理性和情感的反应，与物质输出比较起来 几乎没有得到人们的关注。 

但是，在对待年轻人的问题上，作为人类直接事实的交往本身，越来越重要。48、尽管我们在与年轻人交往时，很容易忽视我们的行为对他们性格的影响，但是与成年人接触或交往却并不那么容易。培训的需要显而易见；实现改变他们态度和习惯的压力十分紧迫，不能完全不顾及这些后果。49、既然我们的主要任务在于使年轻人参与共同生活，我们禁不住考虑我们是否在形成获得这种能力的力量。假如人类在意识到每一个制度的最终价值在于它的特殊的人类影响方面取得了某些进步，我们有充分的理由可以相信，我们主要是通过与年轻人的交往而学到这一点的。 

50、因此，我们可以在上面所考虑的广阔的教育过程之内区别出一种比较正规的教育，即直接的教导或学校教育。我们发现，在不发达的社会群体中几乎没有正规教育和培训。这些群体主要依赖于使成年人对他们的群体保持忠诚的相同交往来向年轻人灌输需要的性格。  

 

\46. It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience; but this effect is not a part of its original motive. 

【本句考点】宾语从句， of 短语作定语，代词指代， but 引导并列句。 

【结构分析】本句的主干是： It may be said that…, but this effect… ；动词said后跟有一个由that引导的宾语从句，宾语从句中的主语是the measure of the worth of any social institution，其中的of 短语作定语，修饰the measure，意为“任何社会制度的价值尺度”；在短语its effect 及 its original motive 中，it 在句中指代 social institution。 

【参考译文】可以说，任何社会制度的价值在于它对扩大和改进经验方面的影响，但是这种影响并不是它原来的动机的一部分。 

\47. Only gradually was the by-product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution.  

【本句考点】强调句的倒装结构。

【结构分析】这是一个由and连接的一个并列句，其中每一个分句都是only短语作状语放句首采用部分倒装的结构：助动词was被提前。正常语序应该是：The by-product of the institution was noted only gradually, and this effect was only still more gradually considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution. 其中，directive factor指导性因素，in the conduct of the institution是介词短语做状语，修饰factor，意为“实施这种制度时的指导性因素”。 

【参考译文】一种制度的副产品，只是逐步被注意到的，而这种效果被视为实施这种制度的一个指导性因素更加缓慢。 

48.While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. 

【本句考点】比较状语从句，动宾分隔。  

【结构分析】本句主干是 while 引导的一个让步状语从句，其中动词ignore 的宾语是the effect of our acts upon their disposition ，即“忽视了我们的行为对他们的性格的影响”；in our contact with 作为一个插入成分，分隔了 ignore 和它的宾语 the effect of… 。  

【参考译文】在和他们接触的时候，虽然容易忽略我们的行动对他们的倾向的影响，但是也不像与成年人打交道那么简单。 

49.Since our chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help considering whether or not we are forming the powers which will secure this ability. 

【本句考点】 since 引导的原因状语从句，代词指代，宾语从句，宾语从句嵌套定语从句。  

【结构分析】本句主干是 Since… we cannot help considering…，其中 whether or not we are forming the powers which will secure this ability（我们是否在形成获得这种能力的力量） 作 cannot help considering（不禁）的宾语， which will secure this ability 作为嵌套定语从句修饰 the powers；两个代词them指代的是年轻人。  

【参考译文】既然我们的主要任务在于使年轻人参与共同生活，我们禁不住考虑我们是否在形成获得这种能力的力量。  

50.We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational process which we have been so far considering, a more formal kind of education -- that of direct tuition or schooling. 

【本句考点】插入语，定语从句，同位语  

【结构分析】本句主干是： We are thus led to distinguish a more formal kind of education.（因此我们被引导去区分一个更加正规的教育）。破折号后面的that of direct tuition or schooling（直接的教导或学校教育的教育）与 a more formal kind of education（一种更加正规的教育）是同位语关系，是对a more formal kind of education进一步解释。这句话中间插入了within the broad educational process which we have been so far considering （在目前为止一直在思考的广泛的教育过程的范围内），作为插入语，其中which we have been so far considering为定语从句修饰 process。 

【参考译文】因此，我们可以在上面所考虑的广阔的教育过程之内区别出一种比较正规的教育，即直接的教导或学校教育。

  在某些地区塑料袋的禁止使用并不是很成功，因此白色污染仍然继续，给当地报纸的编辑写一封信，信内包括

参考范文

 Dear editor， 

​    I have been reading your newspaper for many years and now I am writing this letter to inform you of the pressing situation we are facing now.  

Accustomed to using plastic bags in daily life, some people still take the “white pollution” for granted, which will greatly worsen our environment. As we know, limiting the use of disposable plastic bags is of utmost significance. Therefore, to save the situation from further aggravating, I would like to give the following suggestions: 

First and foremost, groups and individuals who are polluting our environment by using the disposable plastic bags should be severely punished. In addition, the local media can make full use of their own influence to publicize the negative effect of plastic bags and enhance people’s awareness of environmental protection. Last but not least, new technologies should be developed to find possible alternatives with degradable and renewable materials. 

I hope that my suggestions are helpful and your prompt attention to my suggestions would be highly appreciated. 

​                                                           Sincerely yours，

尊敬的编辑： 

您好！ 

好多年来，我一直阅读贵报。我写这封信的目的是要告诉您我们所面临的紧迫形势。 

有些人已经习惯了在日常生活中使用塑料袋，习惯了会使环境恶化的“白色污染”。我们都知道，限制使用一次性塑料袋意义重大。因此，为了阻止形式进一步恶化，提出以下几条建议： 

首先，严厉惩罚那些使用一次性塑料袋而污染环境的个人和团体。其次，地方媒体充分利用自己的影响来宣传塑料袋的副作用，从而提高人们的环境保护意识。最后但也是最重要的，利用新技术开发可降解可再生的可能的替代品。 

希望这些建议对您有帮助，也感谢您对这些建议的关注。

构思与评析： 

本题要求写一封建议信，要求比较具体，话题也比较熟悉，可写的东西比较多。因此这篇小作文题材是大家非常熟悉的，难度适中。 

一般说来，建议信多属于半开放性作文，要求根据所给材料给出有针对性的解决办法或提出合理化的建议。要符合英语书信的基本格式要求。 

由所给的提纲来看，信的内容应该先对不成功的塑料袋禁止发表自己的看法，然后给出2-3条建议，因此这是一封重在建议的信。范文中第一段首先简要说明写信的原因。第二段则提出当前面临的形势，某些地方塑料袋禁止不成功，白色污染仍然存在，危害周围环境；鉴于这种情况，特提出建议。第三段则具体说明提出的三条建议：惩罚塑料袋使用者；发挥媒体作用，宣传塑料袋的危害，提高环境保护意识；研发新的替代品。第四段希望自己的信得到重视。 

本文紧扣主题，包含了要求的所有内容，提出了合理的建议，使用了一些不错的词组和句子。格式规范，逻辑性较强，条理清晰，是篇不错的作文。  

 

书信格式及常用句型： 

考研小作文的书信在格式上比较简单，一般不要求写信头或信内地址，直接从称呼开始，一般以Dear …开始，接下来就是信的重要内容了。应该注意的是在书写正文时，开头一般要写明写信的原因，结尾处要有结束语，然后是签名。签名一般用Yours faithfully,Yours sincerely, Yours,等。熟人朋友之间也可以用Love,Yoursever，等。 

\1. I am much pleased to inform you that……. 非常高兴告诉你……  

\2. I wish to apply for the teaching position you are offering. 我希望申请你们教书的职位。 

\3. Your kind letter of November 22th arrived this morning. 今天上午收到了你11月22号的来信。

写作参考范文 

​    As we can see in the picture, many people, old or young, men or women, are in front of a computer and using the Internet in the space just like a huge web of a spider. The caption in the drawing reads: “the Internet: near or far ”. 

It is obvious that the huge spider web is the symbol of the Internet and the symbolic meaning of the picture is the effect of the Internet 

on people’s way of life. There is no doubt that the 

Internet provides us with considerable convenience. Internet is revolutionizing our way of living, making many things possible which are beyond our dreams. As a communication tool, the Internet makes us closer than ever before by providing immediate communication via e-mail, QQ, MSN or 

ICQ, no matter how far away our friends are. So in this sense, the Internet is making us nearer to each other. 

  However, there are negative effects of the Internet on people’s life. 

As is shown in the picture, people are imprisoned in their own respective small cabins, indulging in their own world. They choose contacting online rather than communicating face to face. Due to the addiction to the fictional world, people seem to have forgotten the traditional and most efficient communication method, and thus indifference has become a not uncommon phenomenon in the modern world. We often hear parents complain that they have less and less time chatting with their children either because their children spend too much time playing games or chatting online with friends or 

strangers. Also there are couples who seldom talk with each other. Therefore, Internet seems to make near people far away. 

  Hence, how to use modern communication tools such as Internet properly has becomes a hot issue in recent years. While we are enjoying the convenience provided by the Internet, we should also bear in mind that human beings are social beings who need real interpersonal interactions. 

Joint efforts are needed to ensure enough time for people especially families to have face-to-face 

communication with each other. Only in this way can we expect a healthy development of the 

relationship among individuals.    

 

构思与评析：  

大作文仍然是图画式作文。写好这篇作文主要在于两点：第一，描述图画。图片描写可能会给一部分考生造成困难，这一点要看学生平时的积累。第二，寓意理解。题目图片看似简单，实则抽象。揭示主题需结合中文提示“网络的近与远”，即网络为人们的生活带来的便利以及不便。这一主题比较贴近现代生活，也是当今大学生熟悉的话题：网络虽然非常便利，让人与人足不出户就可以相互联系，但是人与人之间的直接联系却变得稀少了。  据此，可以列出如下提纲：第一段对所给图画进行描述，许多人在蜘蛛网一样的各自的空间里上网，下面是说明文字：“网络的近与远”。第二、三段对图画的含义进行说明：一方面，网络作为交际手段给我们带来了很大的方便，在这个意义上，网络使人与人的距离拉近了；另一方面，人们过多地沉迷于网络，致使朋友、家人之间面对面的交流变少，在这个意义上，网络使人与人的距离更远。第四段说明自己的观点：应该避免网络的负面影响，加强人与人面对面的交流。  本文从图片的描述入手，明确提出了图画的含义，并多网络的近与远进行了辩证说明，分析透彻，说理充分，是篇难道的佳作。   

译文：  从图中我们可以看到，很多包括年青人和老年人的男男女女正坐在电脑前面，在像一张大蜘蛛网一样的空间内上网。下面是一行说明文字：“网络的近与远”。  很显然，这张大蛛网就是互联网的象征，这幅图的象征意义就是互联网对人们生活方式的影响。毫无疑问，互联网给我们提供了很多的方便。互联网正在改变我们的生活方式，使得以前做梦都不敢想的许多事情成为可能。作为一个通讯工具，互联网通过电子邮件、

QQ，MSN或ICQ，给我们提供了即时通讯，不管我们离得有多远，从而，大大缩短了人们之间的距离。因此，在这个意义上，互联网正在是我们更加接近。  然而，互联网也给人们的生活带来了负面影响。正如图中所示，人们被囚禁在各自的空间里，沉溺在网络中。不是进行面对面的沟通，他们选择在线交流。由于沉溺于虚构的世界，人们似乎已经忘记了传统的最有效的沟通方式，因此，先到社会中互相漠不关心已经成为一个常见的现象。我们会经常听到父母抱怨与孩子们聊天的时间越来越少，因为他们把过多的时间用来玩游戏或者在网上通朋友或陌生人聊天。此外，还有一些夫妇，彼此很少交谈。所以，互联网似乎在使离得很近的人们之间更加遥远。  因此，如何正确使用像互联网这样的现代通讯工具成为近年来的一个热门话题。我们在享用互联网提供的方便之时，一定要牢记，人类是需要真实的人际交流的社会动物。我们应该共同努力，确保人们之间特别是家人之间面对面的沟通。只有这样，我们才能够有望建立人与人之间关系的健康发展。

The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of those hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is  to say it anyway. He is that  bird, a scientist who works independently  any institution. He helped popularize the idea that some diseases not  thought to have a bacterial cause were actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was first suggested.

 he, however, might tremble at the  of what he is about to do. Together with another two scientists, he is publishing a paper which not only  that one group of humanity is more intelligent than the others, but explains the process that has brought this about. The group in  are a particular people originated from central Europe. The process is natural selection.

This group generally do well in IQ test,  12-15 points above the  value of 100, and have contributed  to the intellectual and cultural life of the West, as the  of their elites, including several world-renowned scientists, . They also suffer more often than most people from a number of nasty genetic diseases, such as breast cancer. These facts, , have previously been thought unrelated. The former has been  to social effects, such as a strong tradition of  education. The latter was seen as a (an)  of genetic isolation. Dr. Cochran suggests that the intelligence and diseases are intimately . His argument is that the unusual history of these people has  them to unique evolutionary pressures that have resulted in this  state of affairs.

While still catching up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.

Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those of the males.

Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities” for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men’s,” she observes, “it’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”

Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”

Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish college. “I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”

Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.

#### Text 2

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.

No longer. The Internet – and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting access to it – is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavor.

The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.

This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the report’s authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.

\26.   In the first paragraph, the author discusses

[A] the background information of journal editing.

[B] the publication routine of laboratory reports.

[C] the relations of authors with journal publishers.

[D] the traditional process of journal publication.

\27.   Which of the following is true of the OECD report?

[A] It criticizes government-funded research.

[B] It introduces an effective means of publication.

[C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers.

[D] It benefits scientific research considerably.

\28.   According to the text, online publication is significant in that

[A] it provides an easier access to scientific results.

[B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers.

[C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge.

[D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research.

\29.   With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is required to

[A] cover the cost of its publication.

[B] subscribe to the journal publishing it.

[C] allow other online journals to use it freely.

[D] complete the peer-review before submission.

\30.   Which of the following best summarizes the text?

[A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers.

[B] A new mode of publication is emerging.

[C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication.

[D] Publication is rendered easier by online service.

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.

The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today’s people – especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations – apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.

Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients – notably, protein – to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height – 5′9″ for men, 5′4″ for women – hasn’t really changed since 1960.

Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs. “There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.

Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”

\31.   Wilt Chamberlain is cited as an example to

[A] illustrate the change of height of NBA players.

[B] show the popularity of NBA players in the U.S..

[C] compare different generations of NBA players.

[D] assess the achievements of famous NBA players.

\32.   Which of the following plays a key role in body growth according to the text?

[A] Genetic modification.

[B] Natural environment.

[C] Living standards.

[D] Daily exercise.

\33.   On which of the following statements would the author most probably agree?

[A] Non-Americans add to the average height of the nation.

[B] Human height is conditioned by the upright posture.

[C] Americans are the tallest on average in the world.

[D] Larger babies tend to become taller in adulthood.

\34.   We learn from the last paragraph that in the near future

[A] the garment industry will reconsider the uniform size.

[B] the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged.

[C] genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen.

[D] the existing data of human height will still be applicable.

\35.   The text intends to tell us that

[A] the change of human height follows a cyclic pattern.

[B] human height is becoming even more predictable.

[C] Americans have reached their genetic growth limit.

[D] the genetic pattern of Americans has altered.

#### Text 4

In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw – having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.

That’s a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong – and yet most did little to fight it.

More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped to create.

For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was “like having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of *An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America*. The southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the “peculiar institution,” including a clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.

And the statesmen’s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave states.

Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children – though not Hemings herself or his approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that *all* men were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.

\36.   George Washington’s dental surgery is mentioned to

[A] show the primitive medical practice in the past.

[B] demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days.

[C] stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history.

[D] reveal some unknown aspect of his life.

\37.   We may infer from the second paragraph that

[A] DNA technology has been widely applied to history research.

[B] in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate situations.

[C] historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson’s life.

[D] political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. history.

\38.   What do we learn about Thomas Jefferson?

[A] His political view changed his attitude towards slavery.

[B] His status as a father made him free the child slaves.

[C] His attitude towards slavery was complex.

[D] His affair with a slave stained his prestige.

\39.   Which of the following is true according to the text?

[A] Some Founding Fathers benefit politically from slavery.

[B] Slaves in the old days did not have the right to vote.

[C] Slave owners usually had large savings accounts.

[D] Slavery was regarded as a peculiar institution.

\40.   Washington’s decision to free slaves originated from his

[A] moral considerations.

[B] military experience.

[C] financial conditions.

[D] political stand.

**Directions:**

In the following article, some sentences have been removed. For Questions 41—45, choose the most suitable one from the list A-G to fit into each of the numbered blanks. There are two extra choices, which do not fit in any of the blanks. Mark your answers on **ANSWER SHEET 1**. (10 points)

The time for sharpening pencils, arranging your desk, and doing almost anything else instead of writing has ended. The first draft will appear on the page only if you stop avoiding the inevitable and sit, stand up, or lie down to write. (41)是大家网原创出品

Be flexible. Your outline should smoothly conduct you from one point to the next, but do not permit it to railroad you. If a relevant and important idea occurs to you now, work it into the draft. (42) 是大家网原创出品 Grammar, punctuation, and spelling can wait until you revise. Concentrate on what you are saying. Good writing most often occurs when you are in hot pursuit of an idea rather than in a nervous search for errors.

(43) 是大家网原创出品 Your pages will be easier to keep track of that way, and, if you have to clip a paragraph to place it elsewhere, you will not lose any writing on the other side.

If you are working on a word processor, you can take advantage of its capacity to make additions and deletions as well as move entire paragraphs by making just a few simple keyboard commands. Some software programs can also check spelling and certain grammatical elements in your writing. (44) 是大家网原创出品 These printouts are also easier to read than the screen when you work on revisions.

Once you have a first draft on paper, you can delete material that is unrelated to your thesis and add material necessary to illustrate your points and make your paper convincing. The student who wrote “The A & P as a State of Mind” wisely dropped a paragraph that questioned whether Sammy displays chauvinistic attitudes toward women. (45) 是大家网原创出品

Remember that your initial draft is only that. You should go through the paper many times – and then again – working to substantiate and clarify your ideas. You may even end up with several entire versions of the paper. Rewrite. The sentences within each paragraph should be related to a single topic. Transitions should connect one paragraph to the next so that there are no abrupt or confusing shifts. Awkward or wordy phrasing or unclear sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and prodded into shape.

[A]   To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space between lines so that you can easily add words, sentences, and corrections. Write on only one side of the paper.

[B]   After you have clearly and adequately developed the body of your paper, pay particular attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It’s probably best to write the introduction last, after you know precisely what you are introducing. Concluding paragraphs demand equal attention because they leave the reader with a final impression.

[C]   It’s worth remembering, however, that though a clean copy fresh off a printer may look terrific, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that have gone into it. Many writers prudently store their data on disks and print their pages each time they finish a draft to avoid losing any material because of power failures or other problems.

[D]   It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now that you have developed a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to flesh out whatever outline you have made.

[E]   Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with the thesis, which explains how the setting influences Sammy’s decision to quit his job. Instead of including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel’s crabbed response to the girls so that she could lead up to the A & P “policy” he enforces.

[F]   In the final paragraph about the significance of the setting in “A & P,” the student brings together the reasons Sammy quit his job by referring to his refusal to accept Lengel’s store policies.

[G]   By using the first draft as a means of thinking about what you want to say, you will very likely discover more than your notes originally suggested. Plenty of good writers don’t use outlines at all but discover ordering principles as they write. Do not attempt to compose a perfectly correct draft the first time around.

In his autobiography, Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual powers with extraordinary modesty. He points out that he always experienced much difficulty in expressing himself clearly and concisely, but (46) he believes that this very difficulty may have had the compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations. He disclaimed the possession of any great quickness of apprehension or wit, such as distinguished Huxley. (47) He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics. His memory, too, he described as extensive, but hazy. So poor in one sense was it that he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or a line of poetry. (48) On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the charge made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, he had no power of reasoning. This, he thought, could not be true, because the “Origin of Species” is one long argument from the beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. No one, he submits, could have written it without possessing some power of reasoning. He was willing to assert that “I have a fair share of invention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher degree.” (49) He adds humbly that perhaps he was “superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.”

Writing in the last year of his life, he expressed the opinion that in two or three respects his mind had changed during the preceding twenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds gave him great pleasure. Formerly, too, pictures had given him considerable, and music very great, delight. In 1881, however, he said: “Now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. I have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music.” (50) Darwin was convinced that the loss of these tastes was not only a loss of happiness, but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character.

【解析】因为性别上的差异，女性在压力面前的主要表现。A项过于宽泛，离开了文中关于性别之间讨论的中心。C项只是文章中的一个具体知识点，不能概括文章全部内容。B项只是单纯指出了男女在压力面前的差异，但没有注意文章中侧重女性压力前表现的文意。

 

**Text 2**

\26. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】本题考查的是考生对第一段的理解。根据文章，第一段作者说到，实验室把他们的研究结果递交刊物，刊物的编辑在隐去作者姓名及相关信息后把论文递交给编审，根据审查结果或出版或拒绝出版此篇论文。版权由杂志社保留。研究者必须订阅杂志才能查找此研究结果的相关文章。很明显，此段讲述的是实验室报告的出版程序。选项A刊物编辑的背景信息和选项C作者与出版商的关系及选项D刊物出版的传统流程都未能准确概括本段的含义。

\27. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】从文章本题的答案信息来源在文章的第二段。第二段说到，互联网使接触到科学结果成为一个现实。OECD刚刚发布一个报告，描写了其深远的影响。这份报告使到目前为止赢得不菲利润的很多出版商争相阅读(the report make heavy reading for publishers)。第三段说到核心科学出版市场利润巨大，第四段说到，这种情况正在改变，也是在线出版可能让他们利润下滑，所以让他们有些不安，故答案为C。

\28. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】从文章结构看，文章第一段重点地介绍了传统的出版方式，这种方式使科学工作者只有订购了该科学杂志才可以获得科学的结果。文章第二段介绍一种新型的出版方式——网络出版，使得科技人员容易获得科学结果。第三段谈到科学的价值和投资回报取决于杂志的发行量和易获得性。第四段具体介绍了这一新趋势的主要出版模式。从文章的中心是关于一种新的出版方式，以及它给科学杂志出版带来的影响——可以更方便的获得科学结果。中心词含有access，反应中心的是解，可以确定答案为A。

**Text 3**

\31. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】文中“…listed at over seven feet. If he had ….The bodies.. changed dramatically over the years”可以看出此段主要讲述NBA球员身高的变化;另外，从文章中心来看，可以排出B，C，D。因此选A

\32. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】从第三段“but as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have increased in height by…..”可以看出生活水平对于身体成长起着非常重要的作用;另外，A，B，D选项所涉及的genetic modification ,natural environment 和daily exercise文中并没有提到;

\33. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】题干中提到“most probably..”，通过排出法，可以确定B为最佳选项。

\34. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】最后一段Claire C. Gordon提到90%的制服和工作站仍将会适合新招人员，这就暗示了D选项所提到的内容。另外，可以依据排出法可以知道A，B，C不正确。

\35. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】从全文中心来看，文章并不是以“predict human height”为中心的，而是在谈美国人身高问题。所以C选项为正确选项。

 

**Text 4**

\36. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】 根据文章的逻辑一致性和联系，从第二段的“But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles of slavery…..”可以看出作者在第一段举George Washing(第一任美国总统)对待奴隶的例子是为了说明“美国历史上奴隶制的作用”。因此选C

\37. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】根据排除法A项中的widely是错误的，排除;B项中说的太笼统，而第二段在讲关于slavery. C项中deliberately和made up是不对的。因此选D。

\40. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】从最后一段“after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War…. ”可以看出Washington做出释放奴隶的决定是在他看见黑人士兵在独立战争中的英勇作战以后，因此B为正确选项。

 

**Part B**

\41. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】空前面出现的内容告诉读者如果写文章时只要作者不再试图避免一些事情第一稿就会跃然纸上，在空后第一句里出现了outline这个词，因此41题中也会出现和outline相关的内容。D选项的内容就中提到用什么方式来写作不重要，重要的是定下一个题目，然后可以通过整理笔记来填充你的 outline(提纲)。空前面所提到的坐着写、站着写、躺着写说的正是写作的方式。

42．【答案】[G] 

【解析】选项是在讲draft的问题，所以答案中还会涉及到draft。选项后的句子中提到：一些写作中的错误可以等到修改的时候才去处理。选项的最后提到不要尝试在第一次的时候写出完全没有任何错误的文稿，因此G选项符合这个逻辑。

\43. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】在选项后面出现了that way 所以上文中会说到具体的哪种方式，只有A选项提到了具体的方式，因此符合题意。

\44. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】选项后面提到了these printouts，空前面提到:“在修改过程中，看打印出来的材料比看电脑屏幕容易。”因此44题选项中也会有和打印出来的材料相关的内容。C选项中很明显地有copy 还有 printer对应下文中所提及的打印出来的材料。

\45. 【答案】[E] 

【解析】前文提到Sammy这个人，这是一个线索词，选项中E 和F中都包含这个词，但是此段的主题句提到，在写作中要删去与主题不相关的素材，E选项中instead of adding that paragraph，也就意味着删去了这段。和主题句对应。

而F选项只是在说最后一段的具体内容，和本段的主题句不相关，故不符合题意。

**Part C**

\46. He believes that this very difficulty may have had the compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations.

【解析】本句的考查点是that引导的宾语从句，主干是he believes that….that从句的结构是this very difficulty may have the….advantage of forcing…, and thus enabling…。Of后面forcing和enabling组成的并列结构做advantage的同位语。

【参考译文】达尔文认为正是因为这个困难，促使他对每一个句子进行长时间和针对性的思考，同时也使得他在观察和推理中发现错误。这也就使他具有了别人所不具备的优势。

\47. He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics.

【解析】本句考查点是同位语从句，让步状语从句。主干是he did not accept… the charge made by… that…。其中as well founded作为一个插入成分，对charge进行修饰。made引导的过去分词短语作定语修饰charge。That引导的从句是charge的同位语，包括一个while引导的让步状语从句。

【参考译文】另一方面，虽然有些批评他的人一致认为他善于观察，但不具备推理能力，但是他不同意这种说法。

\49. He adds humbly that perhaps he was “superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.”

【解析】本句考查点是宾语从句，定语从句。主干是he adds …that… 其中宾语从句的结构是he was superior to …in…, and in…。which引导的是things的定语从句。

52、大作文范文

As is illustrated in the picture, the two disabled persons whose crippled legs are bound together do a lot of traveling. Accordingly, this far-reaching picture reflects a common phenomenon in today’s society: the people who are in the dark want to turn the corner but they can not make it respectively and in turn they have to choose to pull together in times of trouble.

There are several reasons accounting for this. Since we have to live in an on-the-move lifestyle, we may encounter various plights, where we would be at a loss rather than to seek for others’ assistance. Further more, if we do not offer help to each other when we confront dilemma, we would not realize our dream. And no issue in China is as basic to build up the society in harmony as to conduct coordination in face of disasters.

Judging from what have been argued above, people have come to realize the value of mutual aid. It is, therefore, necessary that some effective steps be made to advocate spirit of supporting each other. To begin with, the government should make laws to encourage people to unite. In addition, people should enhance the awareness of caring each other especially when they are in trouble. Only in those ways, can we make people, even not being acquaintance, help each other.

By 1830 the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies had become independent nations. The roughly 20 million  of these nations looked  to the future. Born in the crisis of the old regime and Iberian Colonialism, many of the leaders of independence  the ideals of representative government, careers  to talent, freedom of commerce and trade, the  to private property, and a belief in the individual as the basis of society.  there was a belief that the new nations should be sovereign and independent states, large enough to be economically viable and integrated by a  set of laws.

On the issue of  of religion and the position of the church, , there was less agreement  the leadership. Roman Catholicism had been the state religion and the only one  by the Spanish crown.  most leaders sought to maintain Catholicism  the official religion of the new states, some sought to end the  of other faiths. The defense of the Church became a rallying  for the conservative forces.

The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often egalitarian, valuing equality of everything. Bolivar had received aid from Haiti and had  in return to abolish slavery in the areas he liberated. By 1854 slavery had been abolished everywhere except Spain’s  colonies. Early promises to end Indian tribute and taxes on people of mixed origin came much  because the new nations still needed the revenue such policies . Egalitarian sentiments were often tempered by fears that the mass of the population was  self-rule and democracy.

#### Text 1

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.

What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.

Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in “none of the above.” Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. “With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,” Ericsson recalls. “He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.”

This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person “encodes” the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers – whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming – are nearly always made, not born.

\21.   The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to

[A] stress the importance of professional training.

[B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.

[C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.（C）

[D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others.

\22.   The word “mania” (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means

[A] fun.

[B] craze.

[C] hysteria.（B）

[D] excitement.

\23.   According to Ericsson, good memory

[A] depends on meaningful processing of information.

[B] results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises.

[C] is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors.（A）

[D] requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration.

\24.   Ericsson and his colleagues believe that

[A] talent is a dominating factor for professional success.

[B] biographical data provide the key to excellent performance.

[C] the role of talent tends to be overlooked.（D）

[D] high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture.

\25.   Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to convey?

[A] “Faith will move mountains.”

[B] “One reaps what one sows.”

[C] “Practice makes perfect.”（C）

[D] “Like father, like son.”

#### Text 2

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement *Parade* has featured a column called “Ask Marilyn.” People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 – the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It’s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.

Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?

The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.

Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional test best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership – that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.

\26.   Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?

[A] Answering philosophical questions.

[B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.

[C] Telling the differences between certain concepts.（D）

[D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.

\27.   What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?

[A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.

[B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.

[C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.（C）

[D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.

\28.   People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant’s because

[A] the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.

[B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.

[C] vos Savant’s case is an extreme one that will not repeat.（A）

[D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.

\29.   We can conclude from the last paragraph that

[A] test scores may not be reliable indicators of one’s ability.

[B] IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated.

[C] testing involves a lot of guesswork.（A）

[D] traditional test are out of date.

\30.   What is the author’s attitude towards IQ tests?

[A] Supportive.

[B] Skeptical.

[C] Impartial.（B）

[D] Biased.

#### Text 3

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure had been transformed by economic risk and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today’s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial setback – a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This “added-worker effect” could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a saving-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen – and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly parent – and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance – have jumped eightfold in just one generation.

From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.

\31.   Today’s double-income families are at greater financial risk in that

[A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.

[B] their chances of being laid off have greatly increased.

[C] they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics.（C）

[D] they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance.

\32.   As a result of President Bush’s reform, retired people may have

[A] a higher sense of security.

[B] less secured payments.

[C] less chance to invest.（B）

[D] a guaranteed future.

\33.   According to the author, health-savings plans will

[A] help reduce the cost of healthcare.

[B] popularize among the middle class.

[C] compensate for the reduced pensions.（D）

[D] increase the families’ investment risk.

\34.   It can be inferred from the last paragraph that

[A] financial risks tend to outweigh political risks.

[B] the middle class may face greater political challenges.

[C] financial problems may bring about political problems.（C）

[D] financial responsibility is an indicator of political status.

\35.   Which of the following is the best title for this text?

[A] The Middle Class on the Alert

[B] The Middle Class on the Cliff

[C] The Middle Class in Conflict（B）

[D] The Middle Class in Ruins

#### Text 4

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn them – especially in America – the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss’s agenda in businesses of every variety.

Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year – from organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley – have left managers hurriedly peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.

“Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,” says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. “The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders.” Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’s Columbia Business School. “Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one,” he says.

The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore – and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.

The current state of affairs may have been encouraged – though not justified – by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.

\36.   The statement “It never rains but it pours” is used to introduce

[A] the fierce business competition.

[B] the feeble boss-board relations.

[C] the threat from news reports.（D）

[D] the severity of data leakage.

\37.   According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out

[A] whether there is any weak point.

[B] what sort of data has been stolen.

[C] who is responsible for the leakage.（A）

[D] how the potential spies can be located.

\38.   In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that

[A] shareholders’ interests should be properly attended to.

[B] information protection should be given due attention.

[C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.（B）

[D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.

\39.   According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to

[A] see the link between trust and data protection.

[B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data.

[C] realize the high cost of data restoration.（A）

[D] appreciate the economic value of trust.

\40.   It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that

[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe.

[B] FTC’s decision is essential to data security.

[C] California takes the lead in security legislation.（D）

[D] legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

Mothers and fathers can do a lot to ensure a safe landing in early adulthood for their kids. Even if a job’s starting salary seems too small to satisfy an emerging adult’s need for rapid content, the transition from school to work can be less of a setback if the start-up adult is ready for the move. Here are a few measures, drawn from my book *Ready or Not, Here Life Comes*, that parents can take to prevent what I call “work-life unreadiness.”



You can start this process when they are 11 or 12. Periodically review their emerging strengths and weaknesses with them and work together on any shortcomings, like difficulty in communicating well or collaborating. Also, identify the kinds of interests they keep coming back to, as these offer clues to the careers that will fit them best.



Kids need a range of authentic role models – as opposed to members of their clique, pop stars and vaunted athletes. Have regular dinner-table discussions about people the family knows and how they got where they are. Discuss the joys and downsides of your own career and encourage your kids to form some ideas about their own future. When asked what they want to do, they should be discouraged from saying “I have no idea.” They can change their minds 200 times, but having only a foggy view of the future is of little good.



Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should be responsible for teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities around the house and make sure homework deadlines are met. Encourage teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids need plenty of practice delaying gratification and deploying effective organizational skills, such as managing time and setting priorities.



Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of watching TV shows with canned laughter only teaches kids to process information in a passive way. At the same time, listening through earphones to the same monotonous beats for long stretches encourages kids to stay inside their bubble instead of pursuing other endeavors. All these activities can prevent the growth of important communication and thinking skills and make it difficult for kids to develop the kind of sustained concentration they will need for most jobs.



They should know how to deal with setbacks, stresses and feelings of inadequacy. They should also learn how to solve problems and resolve conflicts, ways to brainstorm and think critically. Discussions at home can help kids practice doing these things and help them apply these skills to everyday life situations.

What about the son or daughter who is grown but seems to be struggling and wandering aimlessly through early adulthood? Parents still have a major role to play, but now it is more delicate. They have to be careful not to come across as disappointed in their child. They should exhibit strong interest and respect for whatever currently interests their fledging adult (as naive or ill conceived as it may seem) while becoming a partner in exploring options for the future. Most of all, these new adults must feel that they are respected and supported by a family that appreciates them.

**Directions:**

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (10 points)

The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic intellectual discipline in European universities. However, only in recent years has it become a feature of undergraduate programs in Canadian universities. (46) Traditionally, legal learning has been viewed in such institutions as the special preserve of lawyers, rather than a necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated person. Happily, the older and more continental view of legal education is establishing itself in a number of Canadian universities and some have even begun to offer undergraduate degrees in law.

If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and parcel of a general education, its aims and methods should appeal directly to journalism educators. Law is a discipline which encourages responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides opportunities to analyze such ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. (47) On the other, it links these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to the links journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment on the news. For example, notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights and public interest are at work in the process of journalistic judgment and production just as in courts of law. Sharpening judgment by absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of a journalist’s intellectual preparation for his or her career.

(48) But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more profoundly than an ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the established conventions and special responsibilities of the news media. Politics or, more broadly, the functioning of the state, is a major subject for journalists. The better informed they are about the way the state works, the better their reporting will be. (49) In fact, it is difficult to see how journalists who do not have a clear grasp of the basic features of the Canadian Constitution can do a competent job on political stories.

Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are primary subjects for journalists. While the quality of legal journalism varies greatly, there is an undue reliance amongst many journalists on interpretations supplied to them by lawyers. (50) While comment and reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it is preferable for journalists to rely on their own notions of significance and make their own judgments. These can only come from a well-grounded understanding of the legal system.

**2007****年考研英语真题答案解析**

**SectionⅠUse of English**

1.【答案】［B］

【解析】词义辨析题，A.natives本地人；B.inhabitant居民；C.peoples民族；D.individuals个体。本文首句指出：到了1830年，原来的西班牙和葡萄牙殖民地变成了独立国家。本句解释了这些居住在摆脱殖民地地位而独立的国家的人们对于未来的态度。这里的这里没有限定范围是“本地人”，也没有提及不同的民族，更没有强调个体差异，因此排除其他选项。

2.【答案】［D］

【解析】词汇辨析题。A.confusedly困惑地；B.cheerfully高兴的；C.worried担心的；D.hopefully充满期待地从首句已知这些国家的居民摆脱了西班牙和葡萄牙的殖民统治，虽然文中没有提到独立的过程，但是历史告诉我们，殖民地人们要求独立的愿望是一直存在的，是迫切的，由此可以判断，成立独立国家是殖民地人们的愿望，因此居民们对未来充满了期待，故选择hopefully合适。

\3. 【答案】［A］

【解析】逻辑关系题。A.shared共有；B.forgot忘记；C.attained获得；D.rejected拒绝。本题所在的句子介绍了这些新独立国家的领导人们的治国理念。首先提到了许多领导人们在治国理念中达成共识的部分，这由本句和下一句的内容及第二段首句中的less agreement得到印证，先指出领导人之间理念上的相同之处，再指出他们之间存在的分歧，shared the ideas符合上下文逻辑关系，故为答案。

4.【答案】［C］

【解析】语义辨析题。A.related相关的；B.close接近的；C.open开着的；D.devoted投入的。本句提到的新国家领导人共同的治国理念包括议会制政府等。由这里的representative government，freedom of commerce and trade可以看出，这些都是先进的民主的治国方略，故此处的careers应为“向人才开放的职业”，这样才能让人们人尽其才，发挥自己的作用。其他三项都可以与介词to搭配使用，但放在此外，不符合上下文语义衔接关系。

5.【答案】［C］

【解析】语义辨析题。A.accessto接近；B.successionto继承；C.rightto的权利；D.returnto返回。从前面的“议会制政府”，“向人才开放的职业”，“商业和贸易自由”可以看出这里提到的是推动国家进步和发展，充分调动人们积极性的另一个理念“人们对私有财产的所有权”，故此处选择right.6.［答案］［D］［分析］词汇辨析题。A.Presumably大概的；B.Incidentally偶然的；C.Obviously显然的；D.Generally普遍的。因为这里没有表示与前一句内容相反或转折的信号词，可以判断本句承接上一句内容而来，继续介绍新的独立国家领导人都认同的理念。这里generally表示出后面内容是大家普遍的观点，符合这里的语义衔接关系，故为答案。

7.【答案】［B］

【解析】词汇辨析题。A.unique唯一的；B.common普通的；C.particular特殊的；D.typical典型的本句意为：他们普遍认为新国家应该是独立的主权国家，足够大，能够在经济上切实可行，由一套共同法律让各个新的独立国家联合起来。句中提到integrate，既然是“联合”，各国应该遵循一套共同的法律，故common符合文意。

8.【答案】［A］

【解析】语义辨析题。A.freedom自由；B.origin起源；C.impact影响；D.reform改革……本句涉及到领导人对待宗教的态度。从后面的内容可以看出领导人对尊哪种宗教信仰一种宗教，而禁止人们信仰其他宗教产生分歧，因此可以看出这里谈论的是宗教自由和教会地位的问题，这里的freedom of religion和the position of the church为并列关系。

9.【答案】［B］

【解析】 逻辑关系题。A.therefore因此；B.however然而；C.indeed的确；D.moreover而且。第一段最后两句介绍了新成立的独立国家领导人之间在治国理念方面的共识，这里提到的是他们之间存在的分歧，显然两部分之间为转折关系，故使用however.本题误选在于没有正确判断本句和前文之间的逻辑关系。

10．【答案】［C］

【解析】词汇辨析题。A.with和…；B.about有关；C.among在…之中；D.by通过。本句表明各国领导人之间在宗教问题方面不那么有默契了，among表示“在……之间”，这里among the leadersship表范围。其他几个介词与后面内容搭配作状语时，都不表示范围。

11.【答案】［C］

【解析】 词汇辨析题。A.allowed准许；B.preached宣扬；C.granted承认；D.funded资助本句对首句内容进行解释说明，指出罗马天主教过去在西班牙的地位：是西班牙国教，是唯一得到西班牙王室承认的。由句中的only可判断，西班牙王室只承认罗马天主教。各个选项中只有grant有“承认”之意，故为答案。

12．【答案】［D］

【解析】逻辑关系题。A.since因为；B.if如果；C.unless除非；D.while而。分析本句句意可以看出，前后两部分谈论的是领导人的两种不同观点：多数人致力于人保留天主教为新国家的官方宗教，一些领导人致力于终结不能有其他宗教信仰的状况。显然前后两部分之间存在对比关系，故使用While表示对比。本句前后两部分之间无假设关系和因果关系，因此排除其他选项。

13.【答案】［A］

【解析】固定搭配题。A.as作为；B.for为了；C.under在……之下；D.against反对。前一句提到罗马天主教为西班牙国教，本句承接前一句，指出大多数领导人希望保留天主教为官方宗教信仰，显然这里as the official religion of the newstates是方式状语，与maintain搭配使用，符合语意关系。

14.【答案】 ［C］

【解析】词汇辨析题。A.spread传播；B.interference干涉；C.exclusion排除；D.promised承诺。本句提到一些领导人与众不同的观点：结束不允许有其他宗教信仰的状况。可见，两拨人的观点截然不同，exclusion用在此处符合语境。这里使用spread，interference和influence与前面内容均不构成转折关系。

15.【答案】［B］

【解析】固定搭配题。A.support支持；B.cry哭喊；C.plea恳请；D.wish希望。本句与前一句内容有隐含的因果关系，这是由于一些领导人主张允许信仰其他宗教，因此保卫教会成为保守势力的战斗口号。这里rallyingcry为固定搭配。

16.【答案】［D］

【解析】固定搭配题。本句是对该段首句主题句的解释。从句中的inreturn可以看出，海地对玻利瓦尔的帮助并非无条件的，其条件就是后者承诺废除奴隶制度。这里promisetodosth.意为“答应做某事”。

17.【答案】［B］

【解析】语义辨析题。A.controlling正在统治的；B.former原来的；C.remaining遗留的；D.original原始的。本句提到到1854年为止，其他地区都废除了了奴隶制，只剩余西班牙的某些殖民地。如果选择remaining，则这里意为“西班牙残存的殖民地”，显然与文章第一段提到的“到1830年，原来的西班牙和葡萄牙殖民地都变成了独立的国家”相矛盾，因为这些国家之前都已独立，因此应选［B］，指西班牙的前殖民地国家。

18.【答案】［A］

【解析】语义辨析题。A.slower较慢；B.faster较快；C.easier较容易；D.tougher较难。上文提到玻利瓦尔承诺废除奴隶制，到1854年除了前西班牙殖民地外，其他地区都已废除奴隶制，本题所在句子指出了与此相反的情况：由于新独立的国家仍然需要这些政策所带来的收入，因此，停止印地安人上贡和对混血人种征税的早期承诺实现得颇为···。根据上下文可知，此处是说这个承诺实现得缓慢，不像废除奴隶制那样快，因此，答案为［A］。

19.【答案】［B］

【解析】词汇辩析题。A.created创建；B.produced产生，生产；C.contributed有助于；D.prefered更喜欢。本题所在部分意为“新国家仍然需要这些政策所带来的税收收入”，这些税收收入是这些policies带来的，这里使用produce意思相近，但后者有“产生，带来”之意，前者并无此意，排除。

20.【答案】［D］

【解析】词汇辨析题。A.puzzledby困惑；B.hostileto敌对；C.pessimisticto悲观；D.unpreparedto未准备好。本段前文一直在提人人平等，最后一句指出一种担心情绪：大众未对自治和民主做好准备。由于新的独立国家的人们刚刚摆脱了殖民统治，因此人们还没有充分了解和熟悉自治和民主，这里使用unpreparedfor符合语境。

　

　**SectionⅡReadingComprehension**

　**Part A**

　　**Text 1**

21.【答案】［C］

【解析】结构题。首段提到一个怪现象：出色的足球运动员更可能出生在一年内的前几个月而不是后几个月。在提出该现象之后，作者在该段未对其做进一步解释说明。这是典型的英文文章开篇模式，通过引用或举例的方式引出文章主题，显然作者介绍这一现象是为了引出下面的主题，因此因该在后的内容中寻找答案。通过浏览后面的内容可知，Ericsson和他的同事们致力于研究不同领域的技艺精湛的从业者取得成就的原因，作者在全文末段给出答案。因此可以判断提到的怪现象是用来引出主题，故［C］为答案。

22.【答案】［B］

【解析】识词题。第二段介绍了对首段提到的怪现象的四种推断性的解释，其中第三个解释中首先出现了soccer-madparents一词，既然是对足球疯狂的父母，那么他们选择在出现足球狂热的季节孕育孩子也不足为奇了，此处的soccermania与soccermad意思一致，考生可通过词汇复现这一线索解题。

23.【答案】［A］

【解析】细节题。在第三段Ericsson给出一个有关记忆的例子，然后在第四段对该题研究进行了说明。第二句明确指出好的记忆力是不天生的，而是由个人解码信息能力的强弱决定的，这与［A］意思一致，故该项为答案。

24.【答案】［D］

【解析】细节题。末段最后一句对Ericsson及其同事的研究结论进行了总结：那些技艺精湛的从业者，无论记忆路超群者，还是专家级外科医生，无论是卓越的芭蕾舞演员还是出色的计算机程序员，他们几乎都是后天练就的，而非天生的。［D］正是对该部分内容的归纳概括，故为答案。

25.【答案】［C］

【解析】主旨题。本题是一个典型的中心思想题，与以往考查形式不同的是，这里需要用一个常见成语对全文主旨进行归纳。开篇由优秀的足球运动员出生月份这个话题引出Ericsson对成功是基于天生还是后天这个问题的研究。第三段用一个记忆数字的例子说明练习的重要性。全文末段的出研究结论：那些取得巨大成就的人都是后天练就的，并非天生的。由此可以看出本文的主旨是成就是靠后天的勤奋，即不断的训练和练习取得的，［C］意为“熟能生巧”，与作者传递的信息一致，故为答案。

**Text 2**

26.【答案】［D］

【解析】细节题。该题目提问智力测试的内容，定位在文章首段，首句。智商测试让你完成语言和视觉类推。因此，D对verbal和visualanalogies进行了解释，故为正确答案。

27.【答案】［C］

【解析】推断题。该题目要推断第三段含义。找到主题句，第二句IQ测试的两种形式：一是斯坦福-比奈智力量化表，二是温切斯特智力量化表。因此，两个版本内容不同。故选C.

28.【答案】［A］

【解析】细节题。文章第三段，倒数第二句：象vosSavant那样的超高分数不可能再出现，因为现在的记分建立在同龄人的人口分布统计数字的基础上。而不仅仅是用智力年龄除以生理年龄再乘以100.可见，积分方式的变化是不会出现高分的原因。故选A.

29.【答案】［A］

【解析】推断题。文章尾段第三句提到：一旦人口或情况发生变化，智商测试就可能不准确。随后论证：当智商测试在压力小的环境中，能预测领导能力。在压力大的环境中，智商与领导力负相关，即，预测的内容正好相反。故选A.

30.【答案】［B］

【解析】主旨题。文章尾段暗示了作者的观点。该段第三句作者认为传统的测试对人的某方面能力没有考察到，同时认为测试结果依赖于环境。因此B怀疑态度。

　**Text 3**

31.【答案】［C］

【解析】推断题。第二段提到，家庭夫妻的双薪的副作用，家庭风险提高了。随后，作出解释，以前家庭主要经济支柱失业了或生病了，在家的另一方可以进入劳动力市场。但是现在，在这种情况下，家庭财富的中断不能得到弥补。因此，家庭易受经济变化影响。故选C.

32.【答案】［B］

【解析】细节题。第三段提到布什总统的计划：布什总统致力于将社会保障转换成储备帐户模式，让退休人员将有保障的退休金变成依赖于投资回报率的退休金。这里B是对部分内容的概括。

　 33.【答案】［D］

【解析】细节题。第三段提到医疗储备计划，减免的部分增加了，会出现一些新的大的家庭未来的医疗投资风险，故选D.

34.【答案】［C］

【解析】推断题。在末段发表观点：经济上的不良后果开始出现，政治负面影响可能也不远了。由此可推断，作者认为经济问题解决不好必将导致政治问题。故选C.

35.【答案】［B］

【解析】主旨题。本题是标题型主旨大意题。作者在第二和第三段阐述了中产阶级家庭的经济风险，退休金风险和医疗保障风险增大。风险让这些家庭更加疲惫。文中多次出现risk一词，表明这些风险对中产阶级是雪上加霜。这与B中的onthecliff（在悬崖边上）语义相同。

**Text 4**

36.【答案】［D］

【解析】结构题。文中第一段的例子对应的论点是第二段的内容。这里的倾盆大雨是指美国公司遇到的新的麻烦：数据安全问题。故D正确。

37.【答案】［A］

【解析】细节题。文章第二段尾句：企业老板们面对数据泄露问题采取的措施是：经理们赶紧盯着他们复杂的IT系统和商业流程，以搜索可能存在的安全缺陷。因此A正确。

38.【答案】［B］

【解析】推断题。文章第三段提出EliNoam的观点：为数据安全、备份、恢复设立适当的投资标准是一个管理问题，不是技术问题。因此，他认为公司老板不重视数据的管理。综上所述，B为正确答案。

39.【答案】［A］

【解析】推断题。文章第四段第二句为主题句。信任是最有价值的经济资产，它很容易被毁掉，而修复信任需要花费巨资。没有什么能比一家公司让敏感的个人数据流到别有用心的人手里更能毁掉信任的了。因此，A为正确答案。

40.【答案】［D］

【解析】推断题。文章尾段首句为主题句，现在这种状况，虽然不合理，可能会由于缺乏对数据泄露的法律制裁而加剧。由此可以推断，法律制裁对于数据泄露的必要性。故选D.

**Part B**

41.【答案】［F］。

【解析】第二段全段没有转折词，末句出现了Also，可见该段前后内容一致，为递进关系。末句中出现代词they和them，指代首段提到的孩子，他有什么兴趣，最适合什么，因该是帮助孩子了解他们自身的优缺点，改正缺点。只有了解了自己是什么人，才知道自己适合什么。我们通过对该段中代词的把握以及对最后一个句子中提到的兴趣种类就可以判断41题选［F］。

42.【答案】［D］。

【解析】42题考生很容易错选成［A］，这是因为首句提到rolemodel，这与［A］中的goodexample一致。但是小标题的选择应该是对段落的整体把握，不是只关注部分细节内容。首句提到榜样之后，后面都没有谈到这一内容。显然该段主旨并榜样问题。后面内容中反复出现的一个关键是future，指出家长和孩子们要定期讨论对未来的设想，显然［D］为答案。

43.【答案】［B］。

【解析】本题所在段首句为主题句，指出父母应该教给孩子怎样工作。后面具体解释如何教会孩子们工作：给孩子分配家务，鼓励十几岁的孩子做兼职等。通过这些方式让孩子学会工作的技能。［B］是对主题句的同义转述，是对后细节内容的高度概括，故为答案。

44.【答案】［C］。

【解析】本段未出现明显的主题句，但全段都是在谈论一些娱乐性的业余生活的危害，作者提到玩电子游戏、长时间的看电视剧、长时间的用耳机听音乐等活动会妨碍重要的沟通和思考能力的发展，影响持续的注意力发展。结合首段内容可知，这里作者是向家长提建议，指出如何帮助孩子为未来的工作做好准备。虽然本段没有明确指出应该采取何种措施，由这里提到的危害可限制，这样才不会影响他某些方面能力的发展，故［C］为答案。

45.【答案】［E］。

【解析】本段提到孩子们需要某种节能，处理各种状况。第一、二句中出现dealwith，solve，resolve等词，表示孩子们需要应对、解决某些问题。由此可以推断，作者在本段中提到的是处理和应对各种情况的技能，这与［E］中的coping strategies不谋而合，故该项为答案。

**Part A**

　　To whom it may concern，As a senior student of the university，I am writing the letter to make some suggestions for improving the service of our university library.

　　On the whole，I think our library functions pretty well，but its service is far from being perfect.Firstly，it is quite convenient to arrange an inquiry desk at the circulation hall，which enables the students to ask questions whenever necessary.Then，with the help of a professional librarian，students can go through the procedures more efficiently.In addition，it would be most helpful if the students have access to the latest Issues of foreign magazines.Lastly，you'd better maintain strict order at the reading room.I frequently found myself Disturbed by certain students chatting and smoking there.

　　It is my sincere hope that you will take my advice into consideration and I hold that it will benefit both the students and the university faculty as well.

 Sincerely yours，

　　How impressive the cartoon is in describing one of the most critical characteristic personalities concerning confidence！This cartoon depicts a picture of a football game with two players facing each other.One player is going to kick the ball while the goalkeeper is standing in front of a goal，ready to protect it.But both parties are losing their confidence.The striker magnifies the goalkeeper in his mind so that chances of shooting in are slim.Likewise，the goalkeeper minimizes his own image as if he couldn't defend the goal successfully.Obviously，both of the players in the picture don't have enough confidence and if you have little confidence，how can you achieve your goal in life？

　　The purpose of the picture is to emphasize the importance of self-confidence in our daily life.Confidence is very important in building a career.The belief of what one can achieve and succeed often spells the difference between success and failure.On account of the fast pace of life，competition goes increasingly fierce in all walks of life，imposing tremendous pressure on all individuals.The past few years have witnessed great increase in the difficulty of examinations and employment.Thus we must maintain powerful self-confidence and optimism in the face of challenges so as to survive and succeed.Confidence can be shown in the performance of many people.Take Liuxiang as an example.It is because of his Self-confidence that he never shrinks in front of other experienced players and works wonders again and again.On the contrary，some athletes do well in everyday training，but when facing other people they fail to present the best of themselves for the lack of self-confidence.As the saying goes，confidence is the first step to success！Only by building strong self-confidence can we move closer to our dreams.s，confidence is the first step to success！Only by building strong self-confidence can we move closer to our dreams.is the first step to success！Only by building strong self-confidence can we move closer to our dreams.s，confidence is the first step to success！Only by building strong self-confidence can we move closer to our dreams.

The homeless make up a growing percentage of America’s population.  homelessness has reached such proportions that local governments can’t possibly .

Finding ways to  this growing homeless population has become increasingly difficult.  when homeless individuals manage to find a  that will give them three meals a day and a place to sleep at night, a good number still spend the bulk of each day  the street.

**Directions:**

Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing [A], [B], [C], or [D]. Mark your answers on **ANSWER SHEET 1**. (40 points)

#### Text 1

In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of deference” characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed into “a culture of consumption” launched by the 19th-century department stores that offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a knowledgeable elite,” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation -- language, home ownership and intermarriage.

The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.

Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.

Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”

Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.

\21.   The word “homogenizing” (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means ________.

[A] identifying

[B] associating

[C] assimilating（C）

[D] monopolizing

\22.   According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century ________.

[A] played a role in the spread of popular culture

[B] became intimate shops for common consumers

[C] satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite（A）

[D] owed its emergence to the culture of consumption

\23.   The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S. ________.

[A] are resistant to homogenization

[B] exert a great influence on American culture

[C] are hardly a threat to the common culture（C）

[D] constitute the majority of the population

\24.   Why are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks mentioned in Paragraph 5?

[A] To prove their popularity around the world.

[B] To reveal the public’s fear of immigrants.

[C] To give examples of successful immigrants.（D）

[D] To show the powerful influence of American culture.

\25.   In the author’s opinion, the absorption of immigrants into American society is ________.

[A] rewarding

[B] successful

[C] fruitless（B）

[D] harmful

#### Text 2

Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry -- William Shakespeare -- but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other sights.

The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness. It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-making.

The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus -- and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side -- don’t usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.

The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.

Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 percent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.

It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) -- lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.

\26.   From the first two paragraphs, we learn that ________.

[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC’s contribution to the town’s revenue

[B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage

[C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms（A）

[D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism

\27.   It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.

[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately

[B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers

[C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers（B）

[D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater

\28.   By saying “Stratford cries poor traditionally” (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the author implies that ________.

[A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects

[B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties

[C] the town is not really short of money（C）

[D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid

\29.   According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because ________.

[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending

[B] the company is financially ill-managed

[C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable（D）

[D] the theatre attendance is on the rise

\30.   From the text we can conclude that the author ________.

[A] is supportive of both sides

[B] favors the townsfolk’s view

[C] takes a detached attitude（D）

[D] is sympathetic to the RSC

When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strange happened to the large animals. They suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived. The large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.

That the seas are being overfished has been known for years. What researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in *Nature*, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then.

Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative. One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since no baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around now.

Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the data support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline.” The notion is that people have failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do business.

\31.   The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that ________.

[A] large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment

[B] small species survived as large animals disappeared

[C] large sea animals may face the same threat today（C）

[D] slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones

\32.   We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm’s paper that ________.

[A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%

[B] there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago

[C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount（A）

[D] the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisheries than in the old

\33.   By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, paragraph 3), Dr. Worm means that ________.

[A] fishing technology has improved rapidly

[B] the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded

[C] the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss（C）

[D] the data collected so far are out of date

\34.   Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that ________.

[A] people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time

[B] fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass

[C] the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level（D）

[D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing situation

\35.   The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries’ ________.

[A] management efficiency

[B] biomass level

[C] catch-size limits（B）

[D] technological application

#### Text 4

Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest may be this: artists’ only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century onward, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring, as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s flowers of evil.

You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen so much misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the world today.

After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.

Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda -- to lure us to open our wallets -- they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. “Celebrate!” commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

But what we forget -- what our economy depends on us forgetting -- is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need art to tell us, as religion once did, *Memento mori*: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It’s a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

\36.   By citing the examples of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends to show that ________.

[A] poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music

[B] art grows out of both positive and negative feelings

[C] poets today are less skeptical of happiness（D）

[D] artists have changed their focus of interest

\37.   The word “bummer” (Line 5, paragraph 5) most probably means something ________.

[A] religious

[B] unpleasant

[C] entertaining（B）

[D] commercial

\38.   In the author’s opinion, advertising ________.

[A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art

[B] is a cause of disappointment for the general public

[C] replaces the church as a major source of information（D）

[D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself

\39.   We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes ________.

[A] happiness more often than not ends in sadness

[B] the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing

[C] misery should be enjoyed rather than denied（B）

[D] the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms

 

\40.   Which of the following is true of the text?

[A] Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.

[B] Art provides a balance between expectation and reality.

[C] People feel disappointed at the realities of modern society.（A）

[D] Mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of David Williams, 52, and of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling games are played). During several years of gambling in that casino, Williams, a state auditor earning $35,000 a year, lost approximately $175,000. He had never gambled before the casino sent him a coupon for $20 worth of gambling.

He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he lost $800. The casino issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card", which when used in the casino earns points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to track the user’s gambling activities. For Williams, those activities become what he calls "electronic heroin".

(41) ________. In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two days. In March 1997 he lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot machines at a time, all night, until the boat docked at 5  a.m., then went back aboard when the casino opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing the casino, charging that it should have refused his patronage because it knew he was addicted. It did know he had a problem.

In March 1998 a friend of Williams’s got him involuntarily confined to a treatment center for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams’s gambling problem. The casino included a photo of Williams among those of banned gamblers, and wrote to him a “cease admissions” letter. Noting the medical/psychological nature of problem gambling behavior, the letter said that before being readmitted to the casino he would have to present medical/psychological information demonstrating that patronizing the casino would pose no threat to his safety or well-being.

(42) ________.

*The Wall Street Journal* reports that the casino has 24 signs warning: “Enjoy the fun... and always bet with your head, not over it.” Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free number for counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health. Nevertheless, Williams’s suit charges that the casino, knowing he was “helplessly addicted to gambling,” intentionally worked to “lure” him to “engage in conduct against his will.” Well.

(43) ________.

The fourth edition of *the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* says “pathological gambling” involves persistent, recurring and uncontrollable pursuit less of money than of thrill of taking risks in quest of a windfall.

(44) ________. Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, society is reclassifying what once were considered character flaws or moral failings as personality disorders akin to physical disabilities.

(45) ________.

Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these states are to varying degrees dependent on -- you might say addicted to -- revenues from wagering. And since the first Internet gambling site was created in 1995, competition for gamblers’ dollars has become intense. The Oct. 28 issue of *Newsweek* reported that 2 million gamblers patronize 1,800 virtual casinos every week. With $3.5 billion being lost on Internet wagers this year, gambling has passed pornography as the Web’s most profitable business.

[A]   Although no such evidence was presented, the casino’s marketing department continued to pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino and used his Fun Card without being detected.

[B]   It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior. And in what sense was his will operative?

[C]   By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he could get back to even, he would quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit.

[D]   Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a long time it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a social policy: the most important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the government.

[E]   David Williams’s suit should trouble this gambling nation. But don’t bet on it.

[F]   It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral problems, often defining as addictions what earlier, sterner generations explained as weakness of will.

[G]   The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of online gambling is especially conducive to compulsive behavior. But even if the government knew how to move against Internet gambling, what would be its grounds for doing so?

Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no account in his society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father Bruckberger told part of the story when he observed that it is the intellectuals who have rejected America. But they have done more than that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of intellectual. It is they, not America, who have become anti-intellectual.

First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an intellectual? 46) I shall define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a Socratic (苏格拉底) way about moral problems. He explores such problems consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action which seems appropriate in the light of the factual and moral information which he has obtained. 47) His function is analogous to that of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a manner as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision.

This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as intellectuals -- the average scientist, for one. 48) I have excluded him because, while his accomplishments may contribute to the solution of moral problems, he has not been charged with the task of approaching any but the factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he encounters moral issues even in the everyday performance of his routine duties -- he is not supposed to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. 49) But his primary task is not to think about the moral code which governs his activity, any more than a businessman is expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration of rules of conduct in business. During most of his waking life he will take his code for granted, as the businessman takes his ethics.

The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact that teaching has traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn their living. 50) They may teach very well and more than earn their salaries, but most of them make little or no independent reflections on human problems which involve moral judgment. This description even fits the majority of eminent scholars. Being learned in some branch of human knowledge is one thing, living in "public and illustrious thoughts,” as Emerson would say, is something else.

不难发现，根据前一句“make up a growing percentage”与后一句“reach such proportion that”确定后者是对前者的例证强调。因此，正确答案为A。

\2. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择动词在定语从句中充当谓语。句子叙述到homelessness has reached such proportions that local government can’t possibly _____. “无家可归者所占的比例已经达到地方政府都无法…的地步。”

选项A. stand  忍受；

B. cope vi. 处理，忍受；

C. approve 赞成，批准；

D. retain 保留。

不难发现，句子中“such proportion that local government can’t …”提供信息确定选择“忍受，承受”之意。选项A. stand 忍受，作为及物动词在句子中要直接连接宾语，但是句子中没有宾语，因此该词不符合句子结构；选项B. cope 处理，忍受，作为不及物动词，在句子中表达完整的含义；选项C. approve赞成，批准，“批准”的应该是文件，句子中提到的是无家可归者的数量问题，不能与“批准”连用；D. retain 保留，显然与“无家可归者的数量”不能构成合理的主谓关系。因此，正确答案为B。

\3. 【答案】[D] 

 【解析】**词汇辨析题，**本题目选择介词，选择介词与句子中的动词有直接关系。句子叙述到To help homeless people ____ independence, the federal government must support job training programs,…. “为帮助无家可归者…独立，联邦政府必须提供就业培训项目…。”

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择动词，所在句子的主语、宾语提供信息决定答案。句子叙述到the federal government must support job training programs, _____ the minimum wage, and fund more low-cost housing. “联邦政府必须提供就业培训项目,…最低工资标准，资助更多低收入家庭。”

选项A. raise增加，提高；

B. add加；

C. take 拿来；

D. keep保留。

不难发现，句子中“___the minimum wage”与前面的短语“support job training program提供就业培训项目”和后面的短语“fund more low-cost housing 资助更多低收入家庭”是并列关系，是政府为无家可归者提供的服务。由此提供信息确定选择“提高”之意。选项A. raise增加，提高，“提高最低工资标准”，符合句子含义；选项B. add加，该词指数量的增加，不符合句子含义；选项C. take 拿来，该词不能与“最低工资标准”连用；选项D. keep保留，“保留最低工资标准”，虽然这个短语意义完整，但是不能与前后的政府帮助无家可归者的举动构成并列。因此，正确答案为A。

\5. 【答案】[D] 

   【解析】 **语意辨析题** 本题目选择副词，在句子中限定范围。句子叙述到_____everyone agrees on the numbers of Americans who are homeless. “…每个人同意美国无家可归者的数量。”

C. hardly 几乎不…（常用倒装）；

D. not 置于句首表示部分否定，译为“并不是…”。

不难发现，由于本题包含反义选项，而上文又没有提示，因此应先把下一句中的第6、7两题做出，本题的答案才会迎刃而解。第6题所在的语境句意为“人们对此的估计数字从六十万到三百万不等”。而第7题又说“尽管这一数字可能不同，分析家们却在另外一件事情上的确达成了一致意见”。因此，本题答案应选D. Not，本句意思为“关于美国无家可归者的数量，众说不一”。

\6. 【答案】[C] 

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 句子中的主语、宾语以及介词决定所选择的动词。句子叙述到Estimates ____ anywhere from 600,000 to 3 million. “估计数字…60万到3百万之间。”

选项A. cover覆盖、包括；

B. change改变、变化；

C. range在某范围中变化；

D. differ不同。

不难发现， 句子中要选择动词与 “from 600,000 to 3 million”构成搭配，句子提供信息确定选择“在…范围”之意。选项A. cover覆盖、包括，不能与 “from…to…”构成搭配；选项B. change改变、变化，该词所指的变化是无规律的变化，当然就不涉及在范围内变化的含义；选项C. range在某范围中变化，符合语句含义；选项D. differ不同，一般组成 “differ from…”短语，译为“与…不同”，不符合句子含义。因此，正确答案为C。

7.【答案】[B] 

  【解析】 **逻辑关系题** 本题目选择逻辑关系词，前后两句的逻辑关系决定答案。____ the figure may vary, analysts do agree on another matter:… “…（人们估计的）数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的。”

选项A. Now that既然；

B. Although虽然…但是；

C. Provided 假设；

D. Except 除去。

不难发现，本题所在的语境句中，前文中的may vary与后文中的do agree互为反义，确定二者为转折让步关系。因此，正确答案为B，句子译为“虽然（人们估计的）数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的”。

\8. 【答案】[C] 

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择动词的现在分词形式，句子中的主语提供信息决定答案。Although the figure may vary, analysts do agree on another matter: that the number of the homeless is______. “虽然（人们估计的）数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的：无家可归者的人数正在…。”

选项A. inflating 膨胀；

B. expanding发展、扩张；

C. increasing增加；

D. extending扩充、扩大。

不难发现，句子中“the number of homeless is___” 提供信息确定选择“增加，膨胀”之意。选项A. inflating 膨胀，超过既定标准（尤指通货膨胀）；选项B. expanding发展、扩张，体积增大；选项C. increasing增加，指数量增加；选项D. extending扩充、扩大，指形状变化、拉伸。因此，正确答案为C。语境句意为“无家可归者的数量一直在增加”。

\9. 【答案】[A] 

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择动词，句子中的主语、宾语提供信息决定答案。句子叙述到One of the federal government’s studies ____ that the number of the homeless will reach nearly 19 million by the end of this decade. “联邦政府的一项研究…无家可归者的数量在近十年内将会达到大约1900万。”选择动词，主语和宾语提供信息确定答案。

选项A. predicts预测、预计；

B. displays展示；

C. proves证明；

D. discovers发现。

不难发现，句子中“that the number of the homeless will reach nearly 19 million by the end of this decade. 无家可归者的数量在近十年内将会达到大约1900万。” “近十年会达到1900万”表达未来的状况，确定选择“预测”之意。因此，正确答案为A。

\10. 【答案】[A] 

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择动词，句子中的宾语提供信息决定答案。句子叙述到Finding ways to ____ this growing homeless population has become increasingly difficult. “想办法…这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难.”

选项A. assist帮助；

B. track追踪；

C. sustain承受、支持、供养；

D. dismiss解散。

不难发现, 本文前两段提出无家可归者的问题并略加分析，本段开始解决方法的探讨。句子提供信息确定选择“帮助”之意。选项A. assist帮助，“想办法帮助这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难”，符合句子含义，符合文章中心；选项B. track追踪，，“想办法追踪这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难”，不符合句子含义；选项C. sustain承受、支持、供养，“想办法支持这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难”，符合句子含义，但是与上文的内容“政府提供相关计划帮助无家可归者”却没有联系；选项D. dismiss解散，，“想办法帮助这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难”，符合句子含义，但是与上文的内容“政府提供相关计划帮助无家可归者”却没有联系。因此，正确答案为A。

\11. 【答案】[C]

 【解析】 **逻辑关系题** 本题目选择逻辑关系词，体现前后两句的逻辑关系。句子叙述到___when homeless people individuals manage to find a ___that will give them three meals a day and a place to sleep at night, a good number still spend the bulk of each day ___ the street. “…当无家可归者找到…能提供一日三餐，晚上能睡觉，还是有很多人每天大部分时间…街头。”

选项A. Hence 因此；

B. But 但是；

C. Even即使；

D. Only 仅仅。

不难发现，前、后句子之间体现出让步关系。选项A. Hence 因此，表示因果关系，与本句逻辑关系不符；选项B. But 但是，表示转折关系，与本句逻辑关系不符；选项C. Even即使，表示让步关系，与本句逻辑关系相符，句子译为“当无家可归者找到地方能提供一日三餐，晚上能睡觉，还是有很多人每天大部分时间流浪街头”；选项D. Only 仅仅，表示递进关系，与本句逻辑关系不符。因此，正确答案为C。

\12. 【答案】[B]

【解析】 **词汇/语法结构辨析题** 本题目选择名词，同时这个名词由定语从句来修饰。句子叙述到even when homeless people individuals manage to find a ___that will give them three meals a day and a place to sleep at night, “即使无家可归者最终能够找到一个…，可以给他们提供一日三餐和夜里睡觉的地方”。

选项A. lodging寄宿处；

B. shelter庇护所、避难所；

C. dwelling住处；

D. house房屋。

不难发现，定语从句“that will give them three meals a day and a place to sleep at night 能够提供一日三餐和晚上睡觉的场所”确定选择“庇护所或避难所”之意。选项A. lodging寄宿处，因为无家可归者人数众多，找到寄宿的地方不合常理；选项B. shelter庇护所、避难所，符合句子含义；C. dwelling住处，指正常的居住场所，显然与无家可归者的景况不符；D. house房屋，显然无家可归者找到正规的居家之房屋不符合常理。因此，正确答案为B。

\13. 【答案】[D]

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择动词的现在分词，在句子中充当宾语补足语。句子叙述到a good number still spend the bulk of each day__  _ the street. “很多人仍然每天大部分时间…街头。”

选项A. searching搜寻；

B. strolling漫步、闲逛；

C. crowing拥挤；

D. wandering游荡、徘徊、流浪。

不难发现，无家可归者是流浪街头的。选项A. searching 搜寻，不符合句子含义；选项B. strolling 漫步、闲逛，指悠闲自在的走，显然不符合句子含义；选项C. crowing 拥挤，该词是不及物动词，不能直接连用名词；选项D. wandering 流浪，符合句子含义。因此，正确答案为D。

\14. 【答案】[C]

【解析】 C **逻辑关系题** 本题目选择连词，体现句子之间的逻辑关系。句子叙述到Many others,___ not addicted or mentally ill, simply lack the everyday ___skills needed to turn their lives ___. “其他许多人，…既不吸毒，也没有精神障碍，他们却缺乏使自己生活变…的日常…技巧”选项A. when 当…时候；

B. once一旦；

C. while表示转折关系，意为“尽管”；

D. whereas表示对比关系。

不难发现，句子中“即不吸毒也不饮酒”与“缺乏日常技巧”构成转折关系。因此，正确答案为C。

\15. 【答案】[C]

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择名词，句子中的宾语名词决定所选择的定语（名词）。句子叙述到simply lack the everyday ___skills needed to turn their lives ___. “就是缺乏让自己生活变…的…技巧”。

选项A. life生活、生命；

B. existence存在；

C. survival生存、存活；

D. maintenance维护、坚持、生活费用。

不难发现，“everyday日常的”提供信息确定是一种生活、生存技巧。尤其是过去分词短语“needed to turn their lives ___.”确定选择“生存”之意。选项A. life skills 生活技巧，指生活中的一些常识或者窍门等，与句子含义不符；选项B. existence skill存在技巧，没有该短语搭配；选项C. survival skill 生存技巧，符合句子含义；选项D. maintenance skills 维护技巧，与句子含义不符。因此，正确答案为C。

\16. 【答案】[A]

 【解析】 **固定搭配题** 本题目选择与turn构成的短语。句子叙述到to turn their lives ___. “使生活变….” 不难发现，这里表达“出现转机”之意。选项A. around ,turn around（使）逆转、（使）出现转机；选项B. over ,turn over仔细考虑、移交；选项C. on ,turn on打开开关；选项D. up ,turn up调大、开大、出现。因此，正确答案为A。

\17. 【答案】[B]

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择形容词，在句子中充当定语，被修饰的名词决定所选择的定语。*Boston Globe* reporter Chris Reidy notes that the situation will improve only there are ___programs that address the many needs of the homeless. “波斯顿环球日报记者克里斯雷迪认为只有通过…规划才能解决这些无家可归者的各种需求，这种局面才有可能得到改善。” 

选项A. complex复杂的；

B. comprehensive综合的、全面的；

C. complementary补充的、互补的；

D. compensating补偿的。

不难发现，句子中空格后面定语从句中的many一词；由于要满足无家可归者的许多要求（many needs of the homeless），所以这份计划应该是考虑周全、无所不包的。选项A. complex复杂的，“复杂的计划”与“解决这些无家可归者的各种需求”没有直接联系；选项B. comprehensive综合的、全面的，“全面的计划”与“解决这些无家可归者的各种需求”直接关联，符合句子含义；选项C. complementary补充的、互补的，，“互补的的计划”，句子中只提到一种计划，何谈“互补”；选项D. compensating补偿的，，“补偿的计划”与“解决这些无家可归者的各种需求”没有直接联系。因此，正确答案为B。

\18. 【答案】[C]

 【解析】 **逻辑关系题** 本题目选择逻辑关系词，前后两句的逻辑关系决定答案。句子叙述到_____Edward Zlotkowski, director of community service at Bentley College in Massachusetts, ____it, “There has to be _____of programs. What we need is a package deal. 像马塞诸塞州本特里学院社区服务部主任Edward Zlotkowski所…的：“各种项目必须…运行，我们需要的是一揽子计划”。

选项A. So 因此（因果关系，强调结果）；

B. Since既然（因果关系）；

C. As 正如（引导非限制性定语从句，与前文表示层进关系）；

D. Thus 因而（因果关系）。

不难发现，前面句子叙述到*Boston Globe* reporter Chris Reidy notes that the situation will improve only there are comprehensive programs that address the many needs of the homeless. “波斯顿环球日报记者克里斯雷迪认为只有通过全面的规划才能解决这些无家可归者的各种需求，这种局面才有可能得到改善。”本句叙述到“像马塞诸塞州本特里学院社区服务部主任Edward Zlotkowski所说的…我们需要的是一揽子计划”。显然二者为层进关系，强调递进。因此，正确答案为C。

\19. 【答案】[A]

【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择动词，在句子中充当谓语动词。句子中的主语和宾语决定所选择的动词。句子叙述到Edward Blotkowsk___ it,“There has to be ___of programs. What we need is a package deal.” 提供信息确定选择“表达，说明”之意。选项A. puts口语中和正式场合宣讲是表示“说”；选项B. interprets口译，解释；选项C. assumes认为；选项D. makes 制造。因此，正确答案为A。

\20. 【答案】[D]

 【解析】 **词汇辨析题** 本题目选择名词，句子中的所有格关系决定所选名词。句子叙述到There has to be ___of programs. What we need is a package deal. “各种项目必须…运行，我们需要的是一揽子计划。”

选项A. supervision 监督、管理；

B. manipulation 操作、处理；

C. regulation 管理、调整；

D. coordination协调。

不难发现，句子中“一揽子计划”提供的信息确定选择“协调”之意。选项A. supervision监督、管理，与句子含义不符；选项B. manipulation操作、处理，与句子含义不符；选项C. regulation管理、调整，与句子含义不符；选项D. coordination协调。综合前文中的comprehensive programs that address the many needs of the homeless（应对无家可归者多方面需求的综合性计划）和后文中的a package deal（一揽子交易），不难选出与此意接近的coordination。因此，正确答案为D。

全文翻译无家可归者在美国所占的比例越来越大。而且，无家可归者所占的比例已经大到地方政府都无法应对的地步。为了帮助无家可归者走向独立，联邦政府必须支持就业培训项目，提高最低工资标准和资助修建更多的廉价住房。

   对于美国到底有多少无家可归者，大家的意见并不一致，估计是在60万到3000万之间。尽管人们估计的数字可能各不相同，分析家们对另外一个问题的意见却是一致的：无家可归者的人数正在增长。联邦政府的一项研究预测，在目前这个十年结束之前，无家可归者的数量将接近1900万。

   想办法帮助这些越来越多的无家可归者的任务变得越来越艰巨。即使无家可归者找到了避难所，能提供一日三餐，晚上能睡觉，还是会有很多人每天大部分时间流落街头。部分问题在于许多无家可归的成年人都是酒鬼或者是瘾君子，而且相当多的无家可归者都有严重的精神病。还有许多人虽然不酗酒吸毒，精神也正常，但就是缺乏让自己生活好转的基本能力。《波士顿环球日报》记者克里斯雷迪认为只有通过全面规划来解决这些无家可归者的各种需求，此局面才有可能得到改善。用马萨诸塞州本特里学院社区服务部主任艾德华泽洛特科瓦斯基的话来说就是：“各种规划必须协调运作，我们需要的是一揽子计划”。

**文章解析：根据中心统一原则确定，**

**文章首段主题句是**In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. 尽管人们对社会差异性有没完没了的争议，美国仍然是一步神奇的同化国民的机器。

**第二段确定段落内容方向的语句是**Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. 移民很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们。

不难发现，这篇文章围绕着**美国的移民问题**来展开。

**题目解析：**

**21.** 【答案】[C] 

【解析】该题将识别的短语“**homogenizing**”在文章中定位到第一段首句**In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people.** 作为识词题，按照“方位论原则”：在识别词汇后面找表示“解释说明，逻辑关系”的表达，或者向前面找平行结构。在词汇前面出现。“**In spite of “endless talk of difference,”**”，表达的是**in spite of**引起的转折关系。因此，**homogenizing**应与前文中的**difference**构成反义，只有**C. assimilating** “同化”符合题意。因此答案为C。

**22.** 【答案】[A] 

【解析】**细节题.**该题利用定位词**“the department stores of the 19th century”**定位到文章第一段People are absorbed into “a culture of consumption” launched by **the 19th-century department stores** that offered ‘vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. **“人们融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的“消费文化”，这些百货商店有幽雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品”。**可见，**the culture of consumption**是由这些百货商店发起的。选项A. played a role in the spread of popular culture.在大众文化传播方面发挥作用，与相关信息句动作“融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的消费文化”直接关联；选项B. became intimate shops for common consumers.成为普通消费者的私人商店，与相关信息句动作“融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的消费文化，这些百货商店有幽雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品”没有任何关联；选项C. satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite.满足有知识的精英们的需求，与相关信息句动作“融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的消费文化，这些百货商店有幽雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品”没有任何关联；选项D. owed its emergence to the culture of consumption.商店的出现是消费文化出现的结果，与相关信息句动作“融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的消费文化，这些百货商店有幽雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品”没有任何关联。因此，正确答案为**A. played a role in the spread of popular culture**在大众文化传播方面发挥作用**。**

**23.** 【答案】[C] 

【解析】**细节题.**该题利用定位词**“immigrants”**定位到文章第二段**Immigrants** are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous.**“移民很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们。”** 选项A. are resistant to homogenization. 拒绝均质化，与相关信息句动作“很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们”没有任何关联；选项B. exert a great influence on American culture.对美国文化施加重大影响，与相关信息句动作“很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们”没有任何关联；选项     C. are hardly a threat to the common culture. 对公共文化几乎没有威胁，与相关信息句动作“很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们”直接关联，动作“对公共文化几乎威胁”对应于“不会毒害人们”，体现“同意替换”的关系；选项     D. constitute the majority of the population. 占美国绝大多数人口，与相关信息句动作“很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们”没有任何关联。 因此，正确答案为**C. are hardly a threat to the common culture**对公共文化几乎没有威胁。

**24.** 【答案】[D] 

【解析】**结构题.**该题将例子**“Amold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks”**定位到文章第五段Rodriguez notes that  children in remote villages around world are fans of superstars like **Amold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks,** yet “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”根据**结构题方位论原则**，找例子对应的论点句。因此，例子后面相邻的句子**yet** “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”“**但是一些美国人担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响。**”是论点。选项A. To prove their popularity around the world. 证明他们在世界的受欢迎程度，与相关信息句动作“担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”没有任何关联；选项     B. To reveal the public’s fear of immigrants.表明人们对移民的恐惧，与相关信息句动作“担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”没有任何关联；选项C. To give examples of successful immigrants.给成功移民举例子，与相关信息句动作“担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”没有任何关联；选项D. To show the powerful influence of American culture.表明美国文化的巨大影响力，与相关信息句动作“担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”直接关联，动作“担心为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”对应于“表明美国文化的巨大影响”，体现 “同意替换”的关系。因此，正确答案为**D. To show the powerful influence of American culture**表明美国文化的巨大影响力。

**25.** 【答案】[B] 

【解析】**主旨题 .**该题作为主旨题反映作者观点态度的题目，根据**“方位论原则”**：作者的观点体现在文章尾段的主题句或倒数第二段体现“I”的句子中。题目定位到文章尾段主题句But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.“**但是，当审视美国过去的骚动时，当今的美国社会各项指标不能表明社会环境变得腐败黑暗**”，体现作者的态度是美国社会当前的现状还好。因此，正确答案为**B. successful**  成功的。

全文翻译尽管人们对于美国社会的差异性有没完没了的争议，美国还是一部神奇的同化国民的机器。美国社会呈现出“服饰和话语趋于平民化、一致化，自在随意和尊重缺失”通俗文化的特点。人们融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的“消费文化”。与那些迎合知识精英的优雅舒适的商店不同，这些百货商店有优雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品，不论阶层和背景如何，任何人都可以进入。从而使得购物成为一种公众的、民主的行为。而均质化的其他推动力还包括大众传媒、广告和体育。

​    移民很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们。Gregory Rodriguez为《国家移民论坛》撰写文章，他在报道中指出，如今移民既没有创新高，也不拒绝被同化，1998年移民占美国人口总数的9.8%，而1990年移民人口所占比例是13.6%。现在要考虑一下同化的三个指数：语言，住房所有权和通婚。

​    1990年的人口普查表明“绝大多数移民在美国居住10年后英语说得得好或很好，他们来自15个最常移民的国家。”而这些移民的孩子往往会说双语，精通英语。“到了第三代，大多数移民家庭都不会说他们的本国语了。”因而美国被描述为语言的墓地。到1996年，那些在外国出生，于1970年前移民美国的人拥有的房屋的比例达到75.6%，高于土生土长的美国人的房屋拥有比例，后者为69.8%。

​    在外国出生的亚洲人和西班牙人比土生土长的美国白人和黑人通婚比例高。到了第三代，三分之一的西班牙裔女性嫁给非西班牙裔男士，而41%的亚裔美国女性嫁给非亚裔人士。

​    Rogriguez注意到，世界各地住在偏远村庄中的孩子是诸如阿诺德·斯瓦辛格和加思·布鲁克斯这类超级巨星的影迷。但是一些美国人担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该过同化作用的影响。

​    美国存在分裂问题和骚动吗？没错。国家大了，就会什么东西都会有点儿。但是，当审视美国骚动的过去时，今天的各项社会指标还不能表明社会环境变得腐败黑暗。

**文章解析：根据中心统一原则确定，**

**文章首段主题句是**Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry－William Shakespeare－but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. 正如我们所知的那样，Stratford-on-Avon只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚。但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构。

**第二段确定段落内容方向的语句是**The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. Stratford-on-Avon可敬的居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收

**第三段确定段落内容方向的语句是**However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. 但是，常看戏的人在看戏同时的确会观光一些地方。

**第四段确定段落内容方向的语句是**The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. 但该镇居民却不认可这种观点，地方议政厅并不直接给皇家莎士比亚公司拨款。

**第五段确定段落内容方向的语句是**Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. 无论怎样，该镇居民不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款。

**第六段确定段落内容方向的语句是**It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. 将票价大幅度提高很可惜，因为这会将那些对Stratford最值得拥有的年轻客户赶跑。

不难发现，这篇文章围绕着**埃文河盘的斯特拉特福镇的唯一产业---威廉.莎士比亚：皇家莎士比亚公司和该镇居民之间的问题**来展开。

 

**26.** 【答案】[A] 

【解析】**推断题.**该题目作为推断题，要明确找到指定的前两个段落的主题句。根据**“主题句---细节句原则”，**第一段段落中间句没有转折词，段落首句Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry－William Shakespeare－but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches.“正如我们所知的那样，Stratford-on-Avon**只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚。但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构。**” 和第二段段首句The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue.“Stratford-on-Avon**可敬的居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收。**” 选项A. the townsfolk deny the RSC ’ s contribution to the town’s revenue.居民们否定皇家莎士比亚公司对该镇的税收做出贡献，与相关信息句动作“只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚；但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构；居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”直接关联，动作“否定皇家莎士比亚公司对该镇的税收做出贡献”对应于“怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”，体现同意替换关系；选项B. the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage.皇家莎士比亚公司的演员们台上台下都模仿莎士比亚，与相关信息句动作“只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚；但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构；居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”没有任何关联；选项C. the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms.皇家莎士比亚公司的两个分支机构相处不够融洽，与相关信息句动作“Stratford-on-Avon只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚；但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构；居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”似乎有关联，但是选项中的“the two branches of the RSC**皇家莎士比亚公司的**两个分支机构”与相关信息句中的“**Stratford-on-Avon**有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构”相悖，这种命题陷阱称为“瞒天过海”；选项D. the townsfolk earn little from tourism.居民在旅游业中收益很少，与相关信息句动作“只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚；但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构；居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”没有任何关联。综上所述，可以确定答案为**A. the townsfolk deny the RSC ’ s contribution to the town’s revenue.**居民们否定皇家莎士比亚公司对该镇的税收做出贡献。

**27.** 【答案】[B] 

【解析】**推断题.**该题目作为推断题，要明确找到指定的第三段的主题句。根据**“主题句---细节句原则”，**第三段The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus－and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side－don’t usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. **However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing.** It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall. 从段中的主题句**The playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing** 可以看出，**D. the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater.** 看戏的人除了去剧院之外不会去任何其他地方，不符合题意。[A]和[C]两项内容并未在本段提及。本段倒数第二句**It is the playgoers, …pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants**明确地揭示了正确答案为**B. the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers.** 看戏的人比观光客花钱要多。
 **28.** 【答案】[C] 

【解析】 **识词题.**该题将识别的短语**“Stratford cries poor traditionally”**在文章中定位到第四段The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. **Stratford cries poor traditionally.** Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive. 作为识词题，按照“方位论原则”：在识别词汇后面找表示“解释说明，逻辑关系”的表达，或者向前面找平行结构。在词汇后面出现**“Nevertheless”**，表达的是转折关系，因此相关信息句为Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.**但是该镇的每一家宾馆似乎都在加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，可想而知那里会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵。**从中不难看出，Stratford并非真的陷入财政困难。选项A. Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects. Stratford承担不起扩建计划，与相关信息句动作“加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵”完全相悖；选项B. Stratford has long been in financial difficulties. Stratford长期以来一直陷入财务困难，与相关信息句动作“加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵”完全相悖；选项C. the town is not really short of money.该镇并不是真的资金短缺，与相关信息句动作“加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵”直接关联，体现“同意替换”的关系；选项D. the townsfolk used to be poorly paid.该镇居民过去收入很低，与相关信息句动作“加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵”没有任何关联。因此，正确答案为C。

**29.** 【答案】[D] 

【解析】**细节题.**该题利用定位词**“RSC”和“subsidy”**定位到文章第五段Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the **RSC** needs a **subsidy**. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 percent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) “**无论怎样，该镇居民不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款。（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录。去年，该剧院1431个座位的全年上座率为94%，今年将更高。）**” 选项A. ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending. 可以提高票价来弥补支出，与相关信息句动作“不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录）”没有任何关联；选项B. the company is financially ill-managed. 公司财政管理混乱，与相关信息句动作“不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录）”没有任何关联；选项C. the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable.演员的行为不被社会所接受，与相关信息句动作“不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录）”没有任何关联；选项D. the theatre attendance is on the rise. 看戏的人数量在增加，与相关信息句动作“不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录）”直接关联，体现“同意替换”的关系。 因此，正确答案为**D. the theatre attendance is on the rise.** 看戏的人数量在增加。 **30.** 【答案】[D] 

【解析】**推断题.**该题目作为推断题，要明确找到指定的第六段的主题句。根据**“主题句---细节句原则”，**第六段 It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over)－lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m. 段落中间没有转折词，因此段落的主题句为段首句**It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele.** “**将票价大幅度提高很可惜，因为这会将那些对Stratford最值得拥有的年轻客户赶跑。**”**shame**一词体现了作者的感情色彩。因此，正确答案为**D. is sympathetic to the RSC.** 对RSC感到同情。
 全文翻译正如我们所知的那样，埃文河畔的斯特拉特福只有一个产业，那就是威廉·莎士比亚，但是那儿有两个完全独立的、敌意渐浓的分支机构。一个是皇家莎士比亚公司，它在该镇莎士比亚纪念剧院上演莎翁最好的戏剧作品。另一个是该镇居民，他们在很大程度上靠从来这儿的游客那儿赚钱为生，这些游客来这儿不是为了看戏剧，而是为了看ANNE Hathaway的小屋，莎翁的出生地和其他景点。

​    斯特拉特福镇可敬的居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收。他们坦然承认自己不喜欢RSC公司的演员，那些人留着长发，蓄着胡须，穿着便鞋，吵吵闹闹。想一想他们赖以为生的莎士比亚本人也是位演员（留着胡须），也制造噪音，就具有绝妙的讽刺意味。

​    游客并未完全分流。乘公交车而来的观光者通常会参观离这儿不远的沃里克城堡（Warwick Castle）和布伦海姆宫（Blenheim Palace）。他们通常不会去看戏，一些人在斯特拉特福看到剧院甚至会感到惊异。但是，常看戏的人在看戏同时的确会观光一些地方。皇家莎士比亚公司辩称，正是那些看戏的人为城镇带来大部分税收，这是因为他们在该镇过夜（有些人会呆四五个晚上），在宾馆和餐厅消费。观光客在夜幕降临之前就能看完所有景点，离开城镇。

​    但该镇居民却不认可这种观点，地方议政厅并不直接给皇家莎士比亚公司拨款。斯特拉特福一直在哭穷，但是该镇的每家宾馆似乎都在加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，可想而知那里会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧、里尔休息厅、班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵。

​    不管怎样，该镇居民不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款。（该剧院已经连续三年打破了上座率记录。去年该剧院1431个座位的全年上座率达到94%，今年将更高。）当然，原因是成本增加，而票价却很低。

​    将票价大幅提高很可惜，因为这会将那些对斯特拉特福最值得拥有的年轻客户赶跑。他们来这儿纯粹是为了看戏，而不是观光。他们看起来很相似（尽管他们来自世界各地），脸都瘦瘦的，尖尖的，一脸热诚，穿着仔裤和便鞋，吃圆面包，晚上睡在剧院外面的石板上，在上午10点半售票口开放时买20张座位票和80张专对这些人出售的站席票。

**题目解析：**

**31.** 【答案】[C] 

【解析】**结构题.**该题将例子**“The extinction of large prehistoric animal”**定位到文章第一段When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, **something strange happened to the large animals.** They suddenly became **extinct.** Smaller species survived. **The large,** slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly **hunted to extinction.** Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.” 例子从段落首句开始到倒数第二句结束。根据**结构题方位论原则**，找例子对应的论点句。因此，例子后面相邻的句子**Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.** **“现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生。**”是论点。选项A. large animals were vulnerable to the changing environment.大型海洋动物面对环境变化很脆弱，与相关信息句动作“现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生”没有任何关联；选项B. small species survived as large animals disappeared.由于大型动物消失所以小型动物存活下来，与相关信息句动作“现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生”没有任何关联；选项C. large sea animals may face the same threat today.大型海洋动物可能面对相同的威胁，与相关信息句动作“现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生”直接关联，动作“大型海洋动物面对相同的威胁”对应于“类似现象可能正在海洋中发生”，体现“同意替换”的关系；选项D. Slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones.生长慢的鱼类生存时间比生长快的长，与相关信息句动作““现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生”没有任何关联。因此，正确答案为**C. large sea animals may face the same threat today.** 大型海洋动物可能面对相同的威胁。

**32.** 【答案】[A] 

【解析】**细节题.**该题利用定位词**“Dr Myers and Dr. Worm’s paper”粗略**定位到文章第二段What researchers such as **Ransom Myers and Boris Worm** have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time.利用**“paper”**准确定位到段落的句子According to their **latest paper** published in *Nature*, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then.“根据他们最近发表在《自然》中的论文，一个新的渔场中大型食肉鱼类的数量在开始开发海洋资源的15年间平均下降了80%，在一些旧的渔场，这15年来，大型食肉鱼类的数量在此基础上又减少了一半。”因此，正确答案为**A. the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%.** 有些老渔场大型动物的存活量已经减少了90%。

**33****．**【答案】[C] 

【解析】**识词题.**该题将识别的短语**“these figures are conservative”**在文章中定位到第三段Dr Worm acknowledges that **the figures are conservative.** One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. 作为识词题，按照“方位论原则”：在识别词汇后面找表示“解释说明，逻辑关系”的表达，或者向前面找平行结构。在词汇后面出现**“That means”**，表示解释说明关系相关信息句为**That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes.** “**这意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大。**” 选项A. fishing technology has improved rapidly. 捕鱼技术发展很迅速，与相关信息句动作“意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”没有任何关联；选项B. the catch-sizes are actually smaller then recorded. 实际上捕鱼量比记录的要少，与相关信息句动作“意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”恰恰相反；选项C. the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss.海洋生物群遭受了严重的损失，与相关信息句动作“意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”没有任何关联；选项D. the data collected so far are out of date.目前收集的数据过时了，与相关信息句动作“意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”直接关联，动作“目前收集的数据过时了”对应于“现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”。因此，答案应选**D. the data collected so far are out of date.** 目前收集的数据过时了。

**34.** 【答案】[D] 

【解析】**细节题.**该题利用定位词**“Dr Myers and other researchers”**定位到文章第四段**Dr Myers and Dr Worm** argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. “**Myers博士和Worm博士指出，他们的工作确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内。**” 选项A. people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time.人们应该寻找一个能适用较长时间的基准，与文中定位语句的动作“确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内”没有任何关联；选项B. fisheries should keep the yield below 50% of the biomass.渔场应该将捕鱼量控制在存活量的50%以下，与文中定位语句的动作“确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内”没有任何关联；选项C. the ocean biomass should restored its original level.海洋生物群落应该恢复到原来的水平，与文中定位语句的动作“确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内”没有任何关联；选项D. people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situations.人们应该调整捕鱼的基准以适应时时变化的条件，与文中定位语句的动作“确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内”没有任何关联。可见，定位词定位的语句不能确定唯一正确的答案。**作为细节题，要向下一句一句逐一与选项比较，知道最终确定答案。**后面语句叙述到 **They** believe the data support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the "shifting baseline". “**他们相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准。**” 选项A. people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time.人们应该寻找一个能适用较长时间的基准，与相关信息句动作“相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准”没有直接关联；选项B. fisheries should keep the yield below 50% of the biomass.渔场应该将捕鱼量控制在存活量的50%以下，与相关信息句动作“相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准”没有任何关联；选项C. the ocean biomass should restored its original level.海洋生物群落应该恢复到原来的水平，与相关信息句动作“相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准”没有直接关联；选项D. people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situations.人们应该调整捕鱼的基准以适应时时变化的条件，与相关信息句动作“相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准”直接关联，动作“调整捕鱼基准适应变化的条件”对应于“改变基准”，体现“同意替换”的关系。因此，正确答案为**D. people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situations.** 人们应该调整捕鱼的基准以适应时时变化的条件。

**35.** 【答案】[B] 

【解析】**细节题.** 该题利用定位词**“mainly”粗略**定位到文章第四段**That matters** because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. **Most** fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do business. “**这很重要，因为理论表明当这一目标物种生物群落的数量是原来的50%时，人们能够从渔业得到的最大的可持续性的产出。但大多数渔场的数量低于50%这种做生意的方式很糟糕。**”显然，生物群落的数量和水平决定了从事该行业人的收入。因此，正确答案为**B. biomass level** 生物群落水平。
 全文翻译当史前人类来到地球新的地域时，大型动物发生了一些奇怪的事情，他们突然之间灭绝了，小一点儿的物种得以存活。那些大型的、生长缓慢的动物比较容易猎取，由于被猎杀而迅速灭绝。现在类似的情况可能正在海洋中发生。

​    人们知道海洋中的鱼类过量捕捞已经有些年了。Ransom Myers和Boris worm这些研究人员只是让我们知道了事情变化得多快。他们查询了来自世界各地渔场的50年的数据，目的并非去估算在海洋中的某些特定部分的鱼类的实际数量，而是不同时间内鱼类数量的改变。根据他们发表在《自然》期刊上的最新论文，一个新的渔场中的大型食肉鱼渔类的数量在开始开发海洋资源的15年间平均下降了80%，在一些旧的渔场，这15年来，大型食肉鱼类的数量在此基础上又减少了一半。

​    Worm博士生成这些数字比较保守。一个原因是捕鱼技术有所改进。如今，船只可以借助卫星和声纳定位仪发现猎物，这在50年前无法作到。这意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大。此外，在早些年，多钩长线上可能会挂满更多的鱼，但是因为没有挂了鱼饵的鱼钩来诱惑它们了，所以一些鱼就没被捕到，这就造成了对过去海洋中的鱼类数量估计不足。而且，在早期用多钩长线钓鱼时，许多鱼在上钩后被鲨鱼吃掉了。现在这不成问题了，因为现在鲨鱼数量少了。

​    Myers博士和Worm博士指出，他们的工作确定了一个正确的基准，未来的（海洋）管理必须将其考虑进去。他们相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准。这一观点指出人们没有察觉发生在海洋中的巨大变化是因为他们在审视与现在做对比的过去时，用来衡量这个变化的时间段相对较短。这很重要，因为理论表明当某一目标物种的数量是原来的50%时，人们能够从渔业得到最大的可持续性的产出。但大多数渔场的数量低于原来的50%，这种做生意方式很糟糕。

**36****．**【答案】[D] 

【解析】**结构题.**该题将例子**“Wordsworth and Baudelaire”**定位到文章第二段This wasn't always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from **Wordsworth's daffodils to Baudelaire's** flowers of evil. 根据**结构题方位论原则**，找例子对应的论点句。例子前面相邻的句子**The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy.** “诸如绘画和音乐这样的早期艺术形式最适合表达快乐。”也同样是例子。因此，段落首句**This wasn't always so.**“但情况并不总是这样的。”为论点。但是，该句由于代词**“this”**表达的含义不完整，所以要找到**“this”**的指代，即前一段落的尾句**But the weirdest may be this: artists' only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.** “**最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感。**” 选项A. poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music.在表达快乐时，诗歌的表现力不如绘画和音乐，与相关信息句动作“最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”没有任何关联；选项B. art grows out of both positive and negative feeling.艺术来自正面和负面的情感，与相关信息句动作“最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”没有任何关联；选项C. poets today are less skeptical of happiness.如今的诗人对于幸福少了些怀疑，与相关信息句动作“最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”没有任何关联；选项D. artists have changed their focus of interest.艺术家的关注点发生了变化，与相关信息句动作“最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”相关联，动作“艺术家的关注点发生了变化”对应于“艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”，体现了“包含与被包含”的关系。综上所述，正确答案为**D. artists have changed their focus of interest.** 艺术家的关注点发生了变化。

**37.** 【答案】[B] 

【解析】**识词题.**该题将识别的词汇**“bummer”**在文章中定位到第五段People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a **bummer** too. 作为识词题，按照“方位论原则”：在识别词汇后面找表示“解释说明，逻辑关系”的表达，或者向前面找平行结构。在词汇后面出现**“too”**，表示并列关系，因此相关信息句为**In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms.** “**在西方，在大众传播开始出现，人们开始读书识字之前，最强势的大众传媒是教堂，他提醒那些礼拜者他们的心灵处于危险之中，有一天可能会受到蠕虫的啃噬。**”句子中“心灵处于危险之中，可能会受到蠕虫的啃噬”表现出一种消极不快的情绪和状态。因此，答案应选**B. unpleasant** 不快的。 

**38.** 【答案】[D] 

【解析】**细节题.**该题利用定位词**“advertising”**定位到文章第四段After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting happiness? **Advertising.** The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.“**宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态。**” 选项A. emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art. 广告随着宣扬不幸的艺术觉醒而出现，与相关信息句动作“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，还是意识形态”似乎相关联，但是选项中“**广告**随着宣扬不幸的艺术觉醒而出现”与相关信息句中的“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随**大众媒体**的出现而来”相悖；选项B. is a cause of disappointment for the general public. 广告是普通人失望的原因，与相关信息句动作“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态”没有任何关联；选项     C. replaces the church as a major source of information. 广告取代教堂成为主要的信息来源，与相关信息句动作“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态”没有任何关联；选项D. creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself. 广告带来幸福的幻象而不是真正的幸福，与相关信息句动作“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态”相关联，动作“广告带来幸福的幻象而不是真正的幸福”对应于“在广告文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态”，体现“同意替换”的关系。因此，正确答案为**D. creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself.** 带来幸福的幻象而不是真正的幸福。

**39.** 【答案】[B] 

【解析】**推断题.**该题目作为推断题，要明确找到指定的最后一段的主题句。根据**“主题句---细节句原则”，**第七段 What we forget---what our economy depends on us forgetting---is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone to tell us, as religion once did, *Memento mori*: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It's a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air. 段落中间没有转折词，段落首句What we forget---what our economy depends on us forgetting---is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain.“我们所忘记的（即我们的经济所依赖我们要遗忘的）是幸福，不仅仅是没有痛苦的快乐。”明确是细节。因此段落的主题句为段尾句It's a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.“**这个信息比丁香烟叶还苦，但是会以某种方式带来一股清新的气息。**” 选项A. happiness more often than not ends in sadness. 幸福时常以悲伤终结，与相关信息句动作“比丁香烟叶还苦，但以某种方式带来一股清新的气息”相悖；选项B. the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing. 那些宣扬不幸的艺术令人不快，但是令人有新鲜之感，与相关信息句动作“比丁香烟叶还苦，但以某种方式带来一股清新的气息”相关联，动作“令人不快，但是令人有新鲜之感”对应于“比丁香烟叶还苦，但带来一股清新的气息”，体现“同意替换”的关系；选项C. misery should be enjoyed rather than denied.应该欣赏而不是否认不幸，与相关信息句动作“比丁香烟叶还苦，但以某种方式带来一股清新的气息”没有直接联系；选项D. the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms. 宣扬不幸的艺术在经济繁荣时兴盛起来，与相关信息句动作“比丁香烟叶还苦，但以某种方式带来一股清新的气息”没有任何联系。因此，正确答案为**B. the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing.** 那些宣扬不幸的艺术令人不快但是令人有新鲜之感。

**40.** 【答案】[A] 

【解析】**推断题.**在第五段谈论reminders of misery（痛苦的提醒者）话题时，作者说：the church…reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms（教会提醒朝拜者，他们的灵魂处于危险之中，他们的躯体将成为蠕虫的美食）。在第七段，作者把反幸福艺术的警示作用与宗教的提醒作用等同起来（…we need art to tell us, as religion once did…）。选项**A. Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.** 宗教曾经发挥提醒人们不幸的功能。这与题意完全相符。（**补充：这种提问方式是推断题。按照推断题方位论原则，对应段落的主题句是相关信息句。但是，间或会出现对应段落的主题句与选项没有任何关联，不能确定答案的情况。这种题目就只能利用四个选项分别回归文章定位，通篇考虑，逐一比较才能够确定答案。由于这种题目仅仅考察信息的对应，没有涉及分析理解能力的水平，所以不是考研英语试题中的重点试题。**）

全文翻译有许多事情让人们认为艺术家很怪异，而最怪异的事情是艺术家的唯一工作是探索感情，并且选择关注那些负面感情。

​    但情况并不总是这样的。诸如绘画和音乐这样的早期艺术形式最适合表达快乐。但是大约在19世纪，从英国诗人华兹华斯的水仙花到法国诗人波德莱尔的恶之花，更多的艺术家开始认为快乐是无意义的，虚伪的，甚至是快乐让人感到厌烦。

​    你可能会辩解，艺术对幸福更为怀疑这是因为现代社会目睹了这样的不幸。但是这并非是说在早些时候就没有没完没了的战争，灾难及对无辜者的屠杀。事实上，可能恰恰相反，（艺术对幸福更为怀疑的）原因是如今这个世界有了太多该死的幸福。

​    最终，什么是一种几乎能够完全致力于描绘幸福的现代表达方式呢？广告。宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，还是意识形态。

​    早期的人民被不幸包围。他们一直工作，直到累的筋疲力尽，生活几无保障，年纪轻轻就命丧黄泉。在西方，在大众传播开始出现，人们开始读书识字之前，最强势的大众媒体是教堂，它可以提醒那些礼拜者他们的心灵处于危险之中，有一天可能会受到蠕虫的啃噬。考虑到这些，人们也确实不需要让艺术也变成让人不快的东西了。

​    如今，普通西方人不断接收的并非宗教信息，而是商业信息及永远快乐的信息。食用快餐者，新闻主播，通信员们，所有人的人都在微笑、微笑、不停地微笑。我们的杂志上以容光焕发的名字和住在漂亮房子里的幸福家庭做特写。因为这些信息有秘密目的——诱使我们打开钱包，这让幸福的感觉看起来不可信。在我们发现治疗关节炎的药物Celebrex可能增加患心脏病的风险之前，有关该药物的广告让我们为它的诞生而庆祝。

​    我们所忘记的（也及我们的经济所依赖我们要遗忘的）是幸福不仅仅是没有痛苦的快乐。那些能够带来巨大快乐的东西也会有可能带来巨大的损失和失望。如今，我们周围到处都是唾手可得的幸福的承诺，我们需要有人像过去宗教所做的那样告诉我们“无常”的象征，即记主要你会死去，一切都会消亡，记住幸福不是否认这些，而是与这些共存。这个信息比丁香烟叶还苦，但是会以某种方式带来一股清新气息。

 

**Part B (10 points)**

41．【答案】[C]

【解析】本文通过David William的赌博经历，评述美国社会普遍的赌博现象。本题比较容易。在第一次赌博中，他输了20美元，随后便一发不可收。注意第二段和第三段中数字的递增现象（20→800→……→21,000→72,186）。而在所有选项中，[C]项中的数字5,000正好填补了800与21,000之间的空白，含义也完全吻合上下文。

42．【答案】[A]

【解析】空格前一段谈到：William的一个朋友帮助他进入一家戒赌中心，并把William的问题通知给赌场；赌场发回来一封禁赌信，并说，William必须提供医学或心理方面的证据证明他进入赌场不会对他的身体健康造成损害，否则，赌场不会再准许他去赌博。后一段的大意是：《华尔街日报》报道了赌场的24条声明，比如“以赌为乐……不要过火”；每张门票上都留有心理咨询的免费电话；然而，明知他赌博成瘾，赌场还故意诱惑他“做违背自己意愿的事情”。空格中应涉及赌场重又引诱William去赌博的内容。选项[A]大意为：赌场继续以强大的攻势诱使William进入赌场，而并没有人察觉他是“禁赌人员”。[A]与上下文完全符合，因此是正确答案。

43．【答案】[B]

【解析】空格后一段大意为：一份精神障碍方面的专业杂志说，“病态的赌博”是指持续地、复发性地、不可控制地追求突发横财带来的刺激，而不是追求金钱本身。这显然是在分析“病态的赌博”的症状。而上一段谈到赌场诱使William进入赌场，“做违背自己意愿的事情”。选项[B]的意思是：并不清楚究竟是什么在引诱他；从何种意义来说，他的意愿才算不被强制？此项正好符合上下文逻辑。另外，上文最后一句中的lure一词与[B]项中luring相互照应。因此，[B]是答案。

44．【答案】[F]

【解析】由于本题空格是在段首，因此空格内容与后文关系更为密切。后一句的大意是：在科学或所谓科学的推动下，社会正把曾经认为的性格缺陷或道德缺点重新归类为与身体残疾相似的个性障碍。选项[F]的大意是：令人担忧的是，社会正在用药物处理越来越多的行为问题，并把意志力薄弱定义为“毒”瘾发作。这两句的结构与内涵非常相似，因此应选[F]为答案。

45．【答案】[D]

【解析】空格后文说到：44个州有彩票，29个州有赌场，大多数州都不同程度地依赖着赌博业带来的税收。这显然是一种政府行为。涉及政府行为的有[D]和[G]两个选项，而[G]讲的是本文最后才提到的网络赌博，只有[D]符合题意。

**参考译文**

​    Evansville镇坐落在印第安纳州俄亥俄河的北岸，是52岁的大卫·威廉姆斯的家乡，镇上有一家内河船赌场。威廉姆斯是州政府的一名审计员，年薪35，000美元。在那家赌场赌了几年，他大约输了175000美元。以前他从未参与赌博，直到有一天，那家赌场送他一张价值20美元的赌博优惠券。

​    他去了那家赌场，输了20美元，然后离开了。第二次去赌场他输了800美元。作为一名优秀顾客，赌场发给他一张“娱乐卡”，赌场里使用可以获得积分，换取食物和饮料，赌场也可以以此来追踪使用者的赌博活动。对于威廉姆斯而言，这些活动成为他所谓的“电子海洛因”。

​    在他输了5，000美元的时候，他对自己说如果能捞回本钱，他就会停手。有一天晚上他赢了5，500美元，但是他并未停手。在1997年，他玩投币赌博游戏时两天时间内输了21，000美元。1997年三月间，他输了72，186美元。有时候，他同时玩两台投币机，整晚整晚地玩，直到凌晨5点赌船进港关门为止，在赌场没有禁止他光顾，原因是赌场知道他沉溺其中不能自拔。赌场的确知道他有问题。

​    1998年三月，威廉姆斯在一个朋友在他不情愿的情况下将他送入治疗中心，戒除赌瘾，并写信告知赌场威廉姆斯上瘾的事实。赌场将威廉姆斯的照片放入被禁止赌博的赌徒名单中，给他写了一封“禁止进入赌场”的信。注明了赌博行为的医学/心理学特征，信中指出在允许他重新进入赌场之前，威廉姆斯必须提供证明他光临赌场不会对他的安全和生活幸福造成危害。

​    尽管他没有提供这些证明，赌场的市场部还是不断地给他寄资料。他进入赌场，使用“娱乐卡”，而赌场并未察觉。

​    据《华尔街周刊》报道，该赌场有24个警告牌，写着诸如“享受乐趣，用头脑赌博，不要头脑发热”一类的警告语。每张入场卷上都印着一个免费电话号码，可以向印地安纳州心理健康部门进行咨询。然而，威廉姆斯的诉状指出赌场明明知道他无可救要地沉溺与赌博，却故意引诱他做出违背自己意愿的行为。

​    考虑到他强迫性的行为，赌场是否故意引诱他还不得而知，而他的意愿又体现在那些方面呢？

​    第四版《心理紊乱诊断数据手册》指出，病态赌博指的是在追求意外横财时，持续地、反复地、无法自控地寻求冒险刺激，并非仅仅为了钱。

​    令人不安的是，现在社会越来越多地用医学方法处理行为问题，以前严厉的前辈们称之为意志薄弱的行为现在被认为是上瘾。由于科学或所谓科学的推动，社会正在对行为问题进行重新分类，把从前认为是性格缺陷、道德过失的重新归类到类似于胜利障碍的病态人格。

​    赌博一直是美国人生活中的普遍现象。长期以来，人们认为赌博是一种罪过或者是一种社会疾病。现在赌博却成为一种社会政策：在美国，最主要、最有力的赌博推动者是美国政府。

​    四十四个州发行彩票，29个州设有赌场，而这些州中大多数在不同程度上倚赖于（你可能会说沉溺于）来自赌博的税收。自从1995年建立了第一个赌博网站以来，争夺赌徒资金的竞争加剧。据10月28日那期《新闻周刊》的报道，200万赌徒每周光顾1800个虚拟赌场。今年网络赌徒们输掉的钱达到35亿美元，赌博业已经超越色情业，成为网络上最赢利的行业。

​    美国知识分子受到排斥，人们认为他们在社会中无关紧要，确实如此吗？这里指出的是情况并非那样。Father Bruchbergen让我们了解到部分真实情况。他指出是美国受到知识分子的排斥。然而，知识分子所做的还不止这些，他们对知识分子所发挥的作用日益感到不满。正是他们自己，而不是美国，成了反知识分子者。

首先，我们要对研究对象进行定义。什么是知识分子？我将知识分子定义为这样的人。他把用苏格拉底的方法思考道德问题作为自己的主要责任和人生乐趣。他有意识地、清楚坦诚地探索这一问题，首先针对一些事实问题提问，然后针对道德问题提问，最后根据已经获得的事实和道德信息提出一些看似合理的建议，建议人们如何行动。他的职责与法官相似，必须承担这样的责任：用尽可能明了的方式来展示自己做出决定的推理过程。

 这一定义将许多通常被称为知识分子的人排除在外，那些普通科学家便是其中之一。我把普通科学家排除在外，是因为尽管他们的成就有助于解决道德问题，但却仅仅限于这些问题的事实方面，他们并未承担解决道德问题的任务。与其他人一样，他们会在完成自己的日常任务时遇到道德问题——他不应该伪造实验，捏造证据，修改实验报告。但是科学家的主要任务不是思考支配自己行为的道德准则，正如人们不会期待商人将精力投入到研究商业中的行为规范一样。普通科学家在大部分醒着的时日都会认为自己的道德准则理所当然，这和商人是一样的。

​    这个定义也将绝大多数教师排除在外，尽管从传统意义上来说，多数知识分子的谋生手段是教书。这些教师可能擅长教书，而且不仅仅专注于赚钱，但大多数人很少或者没有对涉及道德判断的人类问题进行独立思考。这种情况也适用大多数杰出学者。在人类知识的某一领域学识渊博是一回事，而：“对社会进行卓越的思考”（爱默生语）则是另一回事。

Dear Sir or Madam,

As a college student who is studying and living in a good environment, I wish to contribute to Project Hope by offering financial assistance to a child in a remote area. Having conceived such a plan for a long time, I write this letter to request your help to recommend a proper candidate.

I wonder if it is convenient for you if three things concerning the child are taken into consideration. First, the child should come from Gansu Province, for I intend to help a child from my hometown. Second, it will be better if the child is a primary school student. I hope I will help him/her from the very beginning. In addition, he/she must be willing to return to his hometown to help built it after graduation from university.

My plan will be carried out as follows. On one hand, I will remit at least 2,000 Yuan in cash every year until he/she finishes his/her education before entering college. On the other hand, I decide to teach the child math and English in person during my summer vacation, which will surely be more beneficial to the child.

Your prompt help would be highly appreciated. And I am looking forward to your reply very soon.

Yours sincerely,

Li Ming

How ironic the two pictures are in describing one of the most widespread social phenomena concerning idol adoration! In the first picture, a young man writes the name of Beckham on his face. In the second picture, another young man spends 300 Yuan in dealing with his hair to make himself look like Beckham.

The meaning conveyed in the two pictures reveals that in current China some young people are losing themselves. I am greatly shocked by the enthusiasm for this British football superstar shown by these two young men. Frankly speaking, things of this kind really happen among us. Some people, especially college students, do nothing but concentrate on imitating superstars. This does great harm to their study and growth. If we can’t stop the worsening of this tendency, our own culture will be damaged, and we ourselves will be the ultimate victims.

From my point of view, a lot of measures should be taken to save our losing culture and re-find ourselves. In fact, some measures have already been taken. In my university, campaigns have been launched to educate people to pay more attention to our traditional culture and read more books instead of focusing on our appearances. As a result, we have witnessed some improvements but still there is a long way to go.

The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers compared with animals,  this is largely because,  animals, we stand upright. This means that our noses are  to perceiving those smells which float through the air,  the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact, , we are extremely sensitive to smells,  we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of  human smells even when these are  to far below one part in one million.

Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another,  others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary to generate  smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the cells which sense smells and send  to the brain. However, it has been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell  can suddenly become sensitive to it when  to it often enough.

The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it  to keep all smell receptors working all the time but can  new receptors if necessary. This may  explain why we are not usually sensitive to our own smells—we simply do not need to be. We are not  of the usual smell of our own house, but we  new smells when we visit someone else’s. The brain finds it best to keep smell receptors  for unfamiliar and emergency signals  the smell of smoke, which might indicate the danger of fire.

#### Text 1

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human,” with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in *Nature*, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services” than males.

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan’s and Dr. de Waal’s study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.

In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

\21.   In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by ________.

[A] posing a contrast

[B] justifying an assumption

[C] making a comparison（C）

[D] explaining a phenomenon

\22.   The statement “it is all too monkey” (Last line, Paragraph l) implies that ________.

[A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals

[B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys’ nature

[C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other（B）

[D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions

\23.   Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they are ________.

[A] more inclined to weigh what they get

[B] attentive to researchers’ instructions

[C] nice in both appearance and temperament（A）

[D] more generous than their male companions

\24.   Dr. Brosnan and Dr. de Waal have eventually found in their study that the monkeys ________.

[A] prefer grapes to cucumbers

[B] can be taught to exchange things

[C] will not be co-operative if feeling cheated（C）

[D] are unhappy when separated from others

\25.   What can we infer from the last paragraph?

[A] Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.

[B] Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.

[C] Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.（B）

[D] Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn’t know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.

There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth’s atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel’s report: “Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions.”

Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it’s OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.

Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it’s obvious that a majority of the president’s advisers still don’t take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research -- a classic case of “paralysis by analysis.”

To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won’t take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.

\26.   An argument made by supporters of smoking was that ________.

[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death

[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant

[C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life（C）

[D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense

\27.   According to Bruce Alberts, science can serve as ________.

[A] a protector

[B] a judge

[C] a critic（D）

Of all the components of a good night’s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just “mental noise” -- the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind’s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is “off-line.” And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better, “It’s your dream,” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago’s Medical Center. “If you don’t like it, change it.”

Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep -- when most vivid dreams occur -- as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the “emotional brain”) is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day.” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.

The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional significance of the day’s events -- until, it appears, we begin to dream.

And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.

At the end of the day, there’s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or “we wake up in a panic,” Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people’s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep -- or rather dream -- on it and you’ll feel better in the morning.

\31.   Researchers have come to believe that dreams ________.

[A] can be modified in their courses

[B] are susceptible to emotional changes

[C] reflect our innermost desires and fears（A）

[D] are a random outcome of neural repairs

\32.   By referring to the limbic system, the author intends to show ________.

[A] its function in our dreams

[B] the mechanism of REM sleep

[C] the relation of dreams to emotions（C）

[D] its difference from the prefrontal cortex

\33.   The negative feelings generated during the day tend to ________.

[A] aggravate in our unconscious mind

[B] develop into happy dreams

[C] persist till the time we fall asleep（D）

[D] show up in dreams early at night

\34.   Cartwright seems to suggest that ________.

[A] waking up in time is essential to the ridding of bad dreams

[B] visualizing bad dreams helps bring them under control

[C] dreams should be left to their natural progression（D）

[D] dreaming may not entirely belong to the unconscious

\35.   What advice might Cartwright give to those who sometimes have bad dreams?

[A] Lead your life as usual.

[B] Seek professional help.

[C] Exercise conscious control.（A）

[D] Avoid anxiety in the daytime.

#### Text 4

Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest book, *Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care*, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.

Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic speciality is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of “whom,” for example, to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.

But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing,” has spelt the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.

Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive -- there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms -- he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china.” A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.

\36.   According to McWhorter, the decline of formal English ________.

[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms

[B] is but all too natural in language development

[C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture（B）

[D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s

\37.   The word “talking” (Line 6, Paragraph 3) denotes ________.

[A] modesty

[B] personality

[C] liveliness（D）

[D] informality

\38.   To which of the following statements would McWhorter most likely agree?

[A] Logical thinking is not necessarily related to the way we talk.

[B] Black English can be more expressive than standard English.

[C] Non-standard varieties of human language are just as entertaining.（A）

[D] Of all the varieties, standard English can best convey complex ideas.

\39.   The description of Russians’ love of memorizing poetry shows the author’s ________.

[A] interest in their language

[B] appreciation of their efforts

[C] admiration for their memory（B）

[D] contempt for their old-fashionedness

\40.   According to the last paragraph, “paper plates” is to “china” as ________.

[A] “temporary” is to “permanent”

[B] “radical” is to “conservative”

[C] “functional” is to “artistic”（C）

[D] “humble” is to “noble”

In the following text, some sentences have been removed. For Questions 41-45, choose the most suitable one from the list A-G to fit into each of the numbered blanks. There are two extra choices, which do not fit in any of the gaps. Mark your answers on **ANSWER SHEET 1**. (10 points)

Canada’s premiers (the leaders of provincial governments), if they have any breath left after complaining about Ottawa at their late July annual meeting, might spare a moment to do something, together, to reduce health-care costs.

They’re all groaning about soaring health budgets, the fastest-growing component of which are pharmaceutical costs.

\41.   ____[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug costs have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part of the increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher prices.____

What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health care -- to say nothing of reports from other experts -- recommended the creation of a national drug agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy, procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, work with Ottawa, and create a national institution.

\42.   ____[C] What does “national” mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.____

But “national” doesn’t have to mean that. “National” could mean interprovincial -- provinces combining efforts to create one body.

Either way, one benefit of a “national” organization would be to negotiate better prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead of having one province -- or a series of hospitals within a province -- negotiate a price for a given drug on the provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces.

Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics suggests the greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood of a better price.

\43.   ____[G] Of course the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; they can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on its list, the pressure will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn’t like a national agency, but self-interest would lead them to deal with it.____

A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation of the Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the provinces. Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to provincial lists which new drugs should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join.

A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. They (particularly Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over additional billions with few, if any, strings attached. That’s one reason why the idea of a national list hasn’t gone anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast.

\44.   ____[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can run it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, and bargain for better drug prices.____

Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow’s report selectively, especially the parts about more federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had to say about drugs: “A national drug agency would provide governments more influence on pharmaceutical companies in order to constrain the ever-increasing cost of drugs.”

\45.   ____[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby’s report: “the substantial buying power of such an agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to negotiate the lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies.”____

So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual complaint list, they should also get cracking about something in their jurisdiction that would help their budgets and patients.

[A] Quebec’s resistance to a national agency is provincialist ideology. One of the first advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec’s Drug Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases from 14.3 per cent to 26.8 per cent!

[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby’s report: “the substantial buying power of such an agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to negotiate the lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies.”

[C] What does “national” mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.

[D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, are, and will continue to increase faster than government revenues.

[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug costs have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part of the increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher prices.

[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can run it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, and bargain for better drug prices.

[G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; they can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to another.

It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this overwhelmingly significant phase in European history. History and news become confused, and one’s impressions tend to be a mixture of skepticism and optimism. 46) Television is one of the means by which these feelings are created and conveyed -- and perhaps never before has it served so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe. The Europe that is now forming cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and national identities. With this in mind we can begin to analyze the European television scene. 47) In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful: groups which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses that work in relation to one another. One Italian example would be the Berlusconi group, while abroad Maxwell and Murdoch come to mind.

Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are going to be able to compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. 48) This alone demonstrates that the television business is not an easy world to survive in, a fact underlined by statistics that show that out of eighty European television networks, no less than 50% took a loss in 1989.

Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige television companies to cooperate more closely in terms of both production and distribution.

49) Creating a “European identity” that respects the different cultures and traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy task and demands a strategic choice -- that of producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to experiences and cultural traditions which are different from our own.

In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on co-productions, the exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the agreements between European countries for the creation of a European bank for Television Production which, on the model of the European Investments Bank, will handle the finances necessary for production costs. 50) In dealing with a challenge on such a scale, it is no exaggeration to say “United we stand, divided we fall” -- and if I had to choose a slogan it would be “Unity in our diversity.” A unity of objectives that nonetheless respect the varied peculiarities of each country.

**Section I  Use of English**  

\1. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】空格前讲的是，和动物相比，人的嗅觉常被认为不灵敏，空格后讲的是，…这主要是因为，…动物，我们是直立的。由本段首句"人的鼻子是一个被低估的工具"可知，作者并不认同"人的嗅觉没有动物的灵敏"这一有关人类嗅觉的常规观点。由此可推知，空格前后部分存在隐形的转折关系，即作者并不认为人的鼻子不灵敏，只不过因为人是直立的，故正确答案为C项。   

\2. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，这主要是因为，…动物，我们是直立的。因人类是直立的，而动物不是直立的。由此可知，空格处所填单词应表示对比含义，unlike意为"与…不同"，符合文意，故选B。  

 \3. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲这意味着我们的鼻子…感知在空气中飘过的气味。由上句可知，和动物不同，人类是直立的，由此可知，人的鼻子只能感知在空气中飘过的气味。因此空格处应填表示"局限"的词。limit和confine都表示"局限"，但confine意为"限制"，表示限制在一定活动、领域、地域内。limit意为"局限于"，表示时间、空间、程度、数量等方面所能或允许达到的最大程度，符合文意，故选A。  

\4. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，…大多数紧贴地面的气味。由上文可知，和动物不同，人类是直立的，人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味。由此可知，人类"不能感知"大多数紧贴地面的气味。catch意为"捕捉"，track意为"追踪"，显然都不符合文意。ignore意为主观上"忽视"，文中并没有体现人们故意忽视地面上的气味，因此，不符合文意。miss意为"错过，未察觉"，符合文意，即人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味，"未能察觉到"大多数紧贴地面的气味。 

\5. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，事实上,…，我们对气味非常敏感。由上文可知，人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味，而遗漏了大多数紧贴地面的气味。由此可知空格所在部分和上文间为转折关系。though作副词时，意为"可是"，符合文意，故选B项。  

\6. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】空格所在句讲的是，然而，实际上，我们对气味非常敏感，…我们通常意识不到这一点。显然，空格前后为让步关系，even if意为"即使"，符合文意，故选A。  

\7. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，我们的鼻子能够…人类的气味。由此可知，空格处需填入一个动词，和后面的"人类的气味"构成动宾搭配。distinguish意为"区分，辨别"，常表示"人通过看、听的感官来识别事物"，discover意为"（第一个）发现"，determine意为"查明，测定"，显然，这三项均不符合文意。detect意为"查明，察觉"，符合文意，即"我们的鼻子能够觉察人类的气味"，故选D。  

\8. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】空格所在句讲即使这些气味被…到百万分之一以下。dissolve意为"溶解"，disperse意为"分散"，diffuse意为"使分散"，这三项均不能修饰human smells。dilute意为"稀释"，合文意，即"我们的鼻子能够觉察人类的气味，即使这些气味被稀释到百万分之一以下"，故选A。  

\9. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】空格所在句的含义为"奇怪的是，一些人发现他们能闻到一种花的气味却闻不到另一种，…另一些人对这两种花的气味同样敏感"。显然，空格前后为对比关系，whereas意为"然而，但是"，用于比较或对比两个事实，符合文意，故正确答案为D项。  

\10. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】空格所在句的含义为"这可能是因为有些人不具备必要的基因在鼻子里产生…的气味接收器"。由文意可知，这句话是对上一句话的解释，即一些人闻不到另一种花的气味是因为他们不具备必要的基因在鼻子里产生…的气味接收器。由此可推知，这种气味接收器是"特定的"，故选B项。 

\11. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】空格所在句的含义为"这些气味接收器是一些细胞，它们感知到气味，并向大脑发送…。""向大脑发送信号"符合逻辑与文意，故正确答案为C项。  

\12. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】空格所在句讲的是，但是，研究发现，即使是对某种气味不敏感的人…，如果经常…这种气味，也会突然变得对它敏感起来。由此可知，本句是讲人对气味的敏感在某种条件下可以改变。因此可推知，"之前"，人对这种气味是不敏感的。at first意为"起初，起先"，符合逻辑与文意，故选A。  

\13. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】空格所在部分省略了主语people和be动词，讲的是人对某种气味由"不敏感"变得"敏感"的条件。由此可推知，人只有经常"闻到"这种气味，才会对它变得敏感，be exposed to意为"暴露于"，符合文意，即"如果经常接触这种气味"，故正确答案为D项。

\14. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲嗅觉不敏感的原因可能是因为大脑觉得，使所有气味接收器一直工作…，考生需判断"所有气味接收器一直工作"的后果。incompetent意为"无能力的，不胜任的"，主语一般是人，因此不合文意。另外，所有气味接收器一直工作也不会"没效果"或"不充分"，因此，A和D也不符合文意。inefficient意为"效率低的"，符合文意，即"所有气味接收器一直工作效率不高"，故选C。  

\15. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，但是在需要时，大脑可以…新的气味接收器。由上文可知，大脑不让所有的气味接收器一直工作，因为那样的效率很低。由but可知，空格所在部分和上文构成转折关系，因此，空格处所填单词应有"使气味接收器工作"的含义。summon意为"召唤"，主语一般是人，因此不符合文意。另外，大脑也不可能"推行"或是"引起"新的气味接收器，因此，选项A和C也不符合文意。create意为"创造；创作"，符合文意，即"但是在需要时，大脑可以创建新的气味接收器"，故选D。 

\16. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】空格所在句讲这可以…解释为什么我们总是对自己的气味不敏感--只是不需要而已。由文意可知，其中"this"指代上一句提到的大脑工作的原理，即"大脑觉得，使所有气味接收器一直工作效率低下"。由此可知，和上一句提到的"嗅觉不敏感的原因"一样，"我们总是对自己的气味不敏感"的原因也能用大脑的这个工作原理来解释。因此，空格所在句和上句为并列关系，also意为"也"，符合文意。  

\17. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，我们不会…自己家里的气味。由上文可知，我们总是对自己的气味不敏感，由此可推知，我们对熟悉的气味不敏感，故我们对自己家里的气味也会"不敏感"。be aware of意为"察觉到，发觉"，符合文意，故正确答案为C项。  

\18. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，我们察觉不到自己家里惯有的气味，但是当我们拜访其他人的家时，就会…新的气味。由"但是"可知，这两句之间为转折关系，因此，空格处所填单词的含义应与"察觉不到"相反。notice意为"意识到"，符合文意，故选D项。  

\19. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，大脑发现最好让气味接收器…以便捕捉不熟悉和紧急的信号，此处for表示对象。由此可知，气味接收器只有是"可使用的"，而不是"可靠的"、"可辨认的"或是"合适的"，才能捕捉不熟悉和紧急的信号，故正确答案为A项。  

\20. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】空格前讲"不熟悉和紧急的信号"，空格后讲"可能意味着有火险的烟味"。"可能意味着有火险的烟味"是"紧急的信号"的一种。由此可知空格前后为例证关系，故选B。

**Part A**                             

**Text 1** 

\21. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第一段第④⑤句可知，不公平意识被认为是"人之常情"，其潜在的假定是其他动物不可能具有如此细腻的不公平意识。然而一项研究表明，这也是"猴之常情"。由此可知，作者在第一段中"通过将人类和猴子进行对比的方式"，引出动物间不公平意识这一话题，comparison一词主要强调比较事物之间的相同之处，故选C项。 

\22. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】推理判断题。根据第一段第④⑤句可知，这种表现被认为是"人之常情"，其潜在的假定是其他动物不可能具有如此细腻的不公平意识。接着作者进行转折指出，"然而一项研究表明，这也是"all too monkey"，由此可知，作者认为猴子之间也具有这种"不公平意识"，故选B项。

\23. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第二段第④句可知，最重要的是，就象人类女性一样，雌性僧帽猴往往比雄性更加关注"商品和服务"的价值。由此可知，雌僧帽猴被选来作研究最主要的原因是它们"更加倾向于注重它们所得的东西"，故选A项。 

\24. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第五段第③句可知，只有当每只猴子感到自己未受欺骗时，这种合作才得以维持。由此可知，猴子们"如果感到被欺骗就不会合作"，故选C项。 

\25. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】推理判断题。据第五段第⑥句可知，这种公平感是在僧帽猴和人类身上各自独立进化而成，还是源自三千五百万年前他们共同的祖先，仍是个"待解决"问题。由此可知，人类愤怒的来源不得而知 

 

**Text 2** 

\26. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】推理判断题。根据第一段第③句可知，作者提问，是否还记得怀疑者们坚持认为"禁烟的游说想毁掉我们的生活方式"，而政府应当置身事外的时候呢？由此可以推知，该问题的隐含之意是吸烟的支持者们认为人们"有选择自己的生活方式的自由"，所以关于"禁烟"的游说就是要"毁掉人们的生活方式"，故选C项。 

\27. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第二段第⑤句提到的艾伯特的观点可知，科学确实能够为我们的未来"提供有效的指引"，关键是我们的国家和整个世界在制定重要决策时，都应以科学能够提供的关于人类现在的行为对未来影响的最佳判断为依据。由此可知，艾伯特认为科学可以作为"引导者"，故选D项。 

\28. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】猜测词义题。根据第四段第③句可知，他们（指美国政府）"没有出台任何行动计划"，反而"只是继续迫切要求进行更多的研究"--这是一个典型的"分析导致麻痹"的例子。由此可知，作者认为不断的分析研究会扼杀行动，故选A项。 

\29. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第五段第③句可知，倘若政府不争取立法上的主动权，国会就应当帮助政府开始制定保护措施。由此可知，作者认为政府应当争取立法的主动权，即采取一些法律措施来应对全球变暖，故选D项。 

\30. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】推理判断题。根据第二段的内容，作者将"吸烟问题"与"全球变暖"进行了对比，指出有的人认为全球变暖的证据不够充分而对其表示怀疑。第三段时作者进一步指出，等有充分证据来证明全球变暖时，一切都太迟了。由此可知，作者认为人们从吸烟问题中吸取的教训（即人们应当及时采取措施，而不是坚持认为证据尚不充分）同样适用于全球变暖问题，故选B项。 

 

**Text 3** 

\31. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第一段第⑤⑥⑦句提到的研究人员的观点可知，一名著名权威人士提到，梦这种异常强烈的精神活动还"可以被我们有意识地控制"。卡特赖特说"梦是你自己的，如果不喜欢，就改变它"。由以上几点可知，研究人员认为，梦在形成过程中"能够被改变"，故选A项。 

\32. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】推理判断题。根据第二段第①句可知，作者指出"大脑造影的证据支持了上述观点"，"上述观点"即首段中提到的观点，作者认为"梦是大脑情感自动调温器的一部分，可对情绪进行调节"。作者在第二段第③句提到了"边缘系统"也是在详细描述"大脑造影的证据"。由以上几点可以推知，作者通过提到大脑的边缘系统，描述了"大脑造影的证据"，从而说明其支持"梦与情感相联系"的观点，故选C。 

\33. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第三段第②句可知，多数人似乎"在晚上入睡不久后做较多噩梦"，而在睡醒之前会逐渐做一些开心的梦，这表明人们在梦里"逐渐消除了白天的不良情绪"。由此可知，白天期间产生的负面情绪往往"出现在夜晚早期的梦中"，故选D项。 

\34. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】推理判断题。根据第四段第①句，这一过程（指做梦）"未必是无意识的"。由此可以推知，作者认为"做梦可能不完全属于无意识行为"，故选D项。 

\35. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】 推理判断题。根据第五段卡特赖特的观点，在一天结束时，只要梦不使我们睡不着或"从梦中惊醒"，就无需去在意它。本段最后也提到"对于那些没有长期受到噩梦困扰的人，安心睡觉--或者做梦，早上醒来时你将会感觉好多了"。由此可以推知，卡特赖特暗示人们只需要"像往常一样生活"。 

**Text 4** 

\36. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第二段第②句可知，麦克沃特先生擅长的学术领域是语言史以及语言演变。他认为诸如"whom"这个正式英语词汇的逐渐消失是"自然的"，并不比古英语中尾格的消失更让人遗憾。由此可知，麦克沃特认为正式英语的退化只不过是语言发展中的自然现象，故选B项。 

\37. 【答案】[D] 

【解析】猜测词义题。根据第三段第①句可知，"走自己的路"这一对事物真实性和个人性的崇高信条，已经使正式演讲、写作、诗歌及音乐的消亡了"，即正式英语已经在退化了。第三段第④句指出，无论作为口语的英语还是书面语的英语，talking要胜过speaking，spontaneity（即兴发挥）也要胜过craft（精心准备）。由此可知，talking与speaking的对比就类似于spontaneity和craft的对比，"即兴发挥"代表使用非正式的语言，"精心准备"代表使用正式的语言。因此talking与speaking的对比也就是非正式英语和正式英语的对比，talking代表的就是非正式英语，故选D项。 

\38. 【答案】[A] 

【解析】细节事实题。根据第四段第④句可知，麦克沃特先生并不认为"我们说话方式不再规范就会影响我们去准确地思考"。换言之，麦克沃特先生认为"逻辑思维同我们的说话方式无必然联系"，选A。 

\39. 【答案】[B] 

【解析】观点态度题。根据第五段的内容，作者首先描述了俄罗斯人爱好背诵诗歌以及意大利的政客们倾向于精心准备演讲。作者举例的目的就是为了说明下文的观点，即"麦克沃特为那些虽不实用却很美好的事物的消逝而哀叹"。由此可知，在作者的眼里，"俄罗斯人爱好背诵诗歌"和"意大利的政客精心准备演讲"都属于"虽不实用却很美好的事物"。由此可以推知，作者对俄罗斯人的做法持欣赏态度，所以才表达出对美好事物正在消逝的哀叹，故选B项。 

\40. 【答案】[C] 

【解析】推理判断题。根据第五段第②③句可知，麦克沃特先生认为"正式英语"并非不可或缺，他也未提出要对教育进行彻底改革--其实他只是为那些"虽不实用却很美好的事物"的消逝而哀叹，如今我们用"纸盘子"而非"瓷盘子"来装我们的英语大餐。这可能是件惭愧的事情，但已经无法避免。由此可知，作者用"纸盘子"和"瓷盘子"来比喻正式英语的退化，联系上文可以推知，"纸盘子"指的是那些"实用却不美好"的事物，即非正式英语，"瓷盘子"则是指那些"不实用却美好"的事物，即正式英语，故选C。

 

**Part B** 

41．【答案】[E] 

【解析】因果关系。空格前面提到加拿大各省官员都在抱怨医疗预算的飞涨，尤其是药品费用的不断增长。空格后面的内容则由"what to do"引出下文对此问题的解决办法。可以看出两段内容衔接紧密，因此空白处的内容也须和"药品费用"有关。浏览各选项，只有E选项提到了"药品费用"，包括药品价格上涨的幅度和具体表现，恰好为上一段提到的"药费"上涨提供了依据，构成因果逻辑关系。 

42．【答案】[C] 

【解析】转折关系。空格前面提到建立国家药物管理机构，空格后面则以"but"引出了转折，说"国家"不一定指那个意思，接下来就表述了它的一个概念，即各省联合起来成立的一个机构。可知，空白处的内容应是对"国家"的一个解释，而代词"that"即指代这一概念。 

43．【答案】[G] 

【解析】顺接关系。空格前面谈到成立国家机构来争取降低药品的价格，如从经济学角度讲，潜在客户群越大，获得优惠价格的可能性就越大。空后讲到成立国家代理机构后取得的一项小突破。据上下文逻辑关系推断，空白处内容也应围绕成立国家代理机构而展开。浏览各选项，提到"national agency" 或同义词的有A, B, G，而对于B项中出现的指代词"they", 无法从上文中找到所指代的相应名词，所以排除。A项最易误选，因为它和上文都提到了专有名词Quebec, 但其内容主要是魁北克地方保护主义的表现和药品上涨的情况，与前后内容不衔接，因此不对。G选项涉及医药公司对设立国家药物机构的反应，表明其成立具有现实可能性，与下文所取得的进展存在着内容与逻辑上的一致性。 

44．【答案】[F] 

【解析】顺接关系。空格前面讲到某些省对联邦政府和省政府之间的交易持怀疑态度，空格后则指出这些省长们应该读读报告中有关药品的论述，了解成立国家药物机构的好处。可以推断，空白处内容要么是继续讨论来自这些省份的阻力，即承上；要么是建议他们更多了解成立国家机构的意义，即启下。符合条件的有B和F两项，但由于B项开头的并列连词 "or" 使其无法与上文衔接，因此不对。F项虽然把上文的关键词"premiers"换成了"provinces", 但其内容还是建议各省实现全国药物代理机构的功能，与上下文内容逻辑关系紧密。 

45．【答案】[B] 

【解析】对照关系。空前指出省长们应该读读Romanow的报告，B项则提到读一读Kirby的报告，结构与上文类似，且还重复运用了关键词 "report", 即暗含两份报告存在意义上的相似或相反特征。另外，两个专有名词Mr. Romanow和Mr. Kirby都已在第四段中被提到，他们都提倡建立国家药物代理机构。 

 

**Part C** 

\46. 【考点】被动语态的翻译，技巧就是通常把英文的被动语态翻译成中文的主动语态，即翻译技巧中的语态转换翻译。这样可翻成这样“电视是制造和传播这种情绪的媒介（手段、方式）之一”。 下面的采分点是倒装句，把否定词放在句前，形成一个倒装。这句翻译要注意，要把整个的句子看懂，进行词性、语序的转换。把“从来也没有如此大的作用”放在句末。这也是翻译的一个转换技巧。  

【译文】电视是创造和传递感情的手段之一。也许在此之前，就加强不同的民族和国家之间的联系而言，电视还从来没有像在最近的欧洲事件中起过如此大的作用。 

\47. 【考点】前面几乎可以直译，“在欧洲就像在其他地方一样多媒体集团越来越成功了”。当然根据中文表达可把句子加以转换，译成“和其他地方一样，欧洲的多媒体集团越来越成熟”。下半句有个定语从句离主干的句子较远，在句末，但翻译时须提前。  

【译文】多媒体集团在欧洲就像在其他地方一样越来越成功了。这些集团把相互关系密切的电视台、电台、报纸、杂志、出版社整合到了一起。 

48.【考点】代词要依赖上下文内容，代词后有副词“alone”，“alone”译成“仅此一点”，“仅这一点就表明在电视行业里生存不那么容易”。此外“underlined”，考了它一个特殊意义 “强调；凸显” 。 

【译文】仅这一点就表明在电视行业不是一个容易生存的领域。这个事实通过统计数字一目了然，统计表明在80家欧洲电视网中1989年出现亏损的不少于50%。 

49.【考点】嵌套式定语从句使主语的后置定语很长，翻译时需要先根据原句的次序梳理思路，再按照汉语的行文习惯，将后置的定语从句提前，放于被限定的名词之前翻译。

【译文】创造一个尊重不同文化和传统的“欧洲统一体”绝非易事，需要战略性选择。正是这些文化和传统组成了连接欧洲大陆的纽带。 

50.【考点】宾语从句为含有对称结构的两个并列分句，过去分词united和divided分别在两个分句中作条件状语。

 【译文】在应付一个如此规模的挑战过程中，我们可以毫不夸张地说，“团结，我们就会站起来；分裂，我们就会倒下去。”

A Letter, to Quit

Jun 22, 2005

Dear Mr. Wang,

First of all, please allow me to express my deep sorry to you for my resignation. I do know that this will bring about much trouble to you so that I write to you for my explanation.

I decided to quit for some reasons as follows. To begin with, the job as an editor for the magazine Designs & Fashions is not suitable to me. What’s more, I am preparing for another degree and I prefer to further my study. Again, I apologize for my resignation to you!

I am looking forward to your early reply.

Sincerely yours,

\52. 参考范文

A Helpless Father

The picture ironically shows that a pitiable old man in rags is being helplessly kicked off by his three sons and a daughter, who all wear decent clothes. The father’s negligent children are all guarding their home gates lest their old father “roll into” their households. In other words, they four ignore their moral sense of assuming the responsibility for their old father even though they may be all living a satisfying life. That is a painful scene we often encounter in our daily life.

Sad to say, the moral decline of the younger generations may be a rather explosive situation in our modern society. People definitely have their living conditions improved by wider and wider margins, as evidenced by the four children’s decent dressing, but their moral sense still remains sadly unchanged or in some cases becomes dramatically downgrading. Most people might have become too much self-centered, and even worse, they discard the tradition of giving respect to the elderly. They no longer care for their elders, let alone their neighbors or the disadvantaged; instead they try every means to avoid responsibility for other citizens. When one cares for others, one might even appear stupid or may even be distrusted.

Therefore, we have to take some useful measures to avoid the scene that is mentioned above. We must launch a variety of campaigns about the return to the good tradition of giving help and love to the elderly. Moreover, we must appeal to our government to establish some relevant laws to punish those who avoid their duties. The last but not the least, our respect for age is an indication of the progress of human society, as imperatives of traditions require. We sincerely wish that the old man could be welcome to any of the four households, elegantly dressed, and a smile on the face.

**Directions:**

Read the following text. Choose the best word (s) for each numbered blank and mark [A], [B], [C] or [D] on **ANSWER SHEET 1**. (10 points)

Many theories concerning the causes of juvenile delinquency (crimes committed by young people) focus either on the individual or on society as the major contributing influence. Theories  on the individual suggest that children engage in criminal behavior  they were not sufficiently penalized for previous misdeeds or that they have learned criminal behavior through  with others. Theories focusing on the role of society suggest that children commit crimes in  to their failure to rise above their socioeconomic status,  as a rejection of middle-class values.

Most theories of juvenile delinquency have focused on children from disadvantaged families,  the fact that children from wealthy homes also commit crimes. The latter may commit crimes  lack of adequate parental control. All theories, however, are tentative and are  to criticism.

Changes in the social structure may indirectly  juvenile crime rates. For example, changes in the economy that  to fewer job opportunities for youth and rising unemployment  make gainful employment increasingly difficult to obtain. The resulting discontent may in  lead more youths into criminal behavior.

Families have also  changes these years. More families consist of one-parent households or two working parents; , children are likely to have less supervision at home  was common in the traditional family . This lack of parental supervision is thought to be an influence on juvenile crime rates. Other  causes of offensive acts include frustration or failure in school, the increased  of drugs and alcohol, and the growing  of child abuse and child neglect. All these conditions tend to increase the probability of a child committing a criminal act,  a direct causal relationship has not yet been established.

### Part A

**Directions:**

Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing [A], [B], [C] or [D]. Mark your answers on **ANSWER SHEET 1**. (40 points)

#### Text 1

Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across CareerBuilder, a job database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site’s “personal search agent.” It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as location, title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the database. Redmon chose the keywords *legal, intellectual property,* and *Washington, D.C*. Three weeks later, he got his first notification of an opening. “I struck gold,” says Redmon, who E-mailed his resume to the employer and won a position as in-house counsel for a company.

With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding promising openings can be time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the databases. But although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. Narrowing your criteria, for example, may work against you: “Every time you answer a question you eliminate a possibility.” says one expert.

For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept—what you think you want to do -- then broaden it. “None of these programs do that,” says another expert. “There’s no career counseling implicit in all of this.” Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database; when you get E-mail, consider it a reminder to check the database again. “I would not rely on agents for finding everything that is added to a database that might interest me,” says the author of a job-searching guide.

Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite’s agent sends out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only three potential jobs -- those it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in the database; job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them -- and they do. “On the day after we send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our traffic,” says Seth Peets, vice president of marketing for CareerSite.

Even those who aren’t hunting for jobs may find search agents worthwhile. Some use them to keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on compensation to arm themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily employed, Redmon maintains his agent at CareerBuilder. “You always keep your eyes open,” he says. Working with a personal search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for you.

\41.   How did Redmon find his job?

[A] By searching openings in a job database.

[B] By posting a matching position in a database.

[C] By using a special service of a database.（C）

[D] By E-mailing his resume to a database.

\42.   Which of the following can be a disadvantage of search agents?

\44.   Why does CareerSite’s agent offer each job hunter only three job options?

[A] To focus on better job matches.

[B] To attract more returning visits.

[C] To reserve space for more messages.（B）

[D] To increase the rate of success.

Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned or made illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.

It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over Zodiac cars when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbott has in life over Zoë Zysman. English names are fairly evenly spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K.

Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C respectively; and 26 of George Bush’s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chrétien and Koizumi). The world’s three top central bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters. As are the world’s five richest men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).

Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot sets in early. At the start of the first year in infant school, teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their names. So short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, and is rarely asked the improving questions posed by those insensitive teachers. At the time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, because they get less individual attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.

The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ. Shortlists for job interviews, election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all tend to be drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they plough through them.

\46.   What does the author intend to illustrate with AAA A cars and Zodiac cars?

[A] A kind of overlooked inequality.

[B] A type of conspicuous bias.

[C] A type of personal prejudice.（A）

[D] A kind of brand discrimination.

\47.   What can we infer from the first three paragraphs?

[A] In both East and West, names are essential to success.

[B] The alphabet is to blame for the failure of Zoë Zysman.

[C] Customers often pay a lot of attention to companies’ names.（D）

[D] Some form of discrimination is too subtle to recognize.

\48.   The 4th paragraph suggests that ________.

[A] questions are often put to the more intelligent students

[B] alphabetically disadvantaged students often escape from class

[C] teachers should pay attention to all of their students（C）

[D] students should be seated according to their eyesight

\49.   What does the author mean by “most people are literally having a ZZZ” (Lines 2-3, Paragraph 5)?

[A] They are getting impatient.

[B] They are noisily dozing off.

[C] They are feeling humiliated.（B）

[D] They are busy with word puzzles.

\50.   Which of the following is true according to the text?

[A] People with surnames beginning with N to Z are often ill-treated.

[B] VIPs in the Western world gain a great deal from alphabetism.

[C] The campaign to eliminate alphabetism still has a long way to go.（D）

[D] Putting things alphabetically may lead to unintentional bias.

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet. But the 47-year-old manicurist isn’t cutting, filling or polishing as many nails as she’d like to, either. Most of her clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. “I’m a good economic indicator,” she says. “I provide a service that people can do without when they’re concerned about saving some dollars.” So Spero is downscaling, shopping at middle-brow Dillard’s department store near her suburban Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. “I don’t know if other clients are going to abandon me, too.” she says.

Even before Alan Greenspan’s admission that America’s red-hot economy is cooling, lots of working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships to Gap outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last year’s pace. But don’t sound any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy’s long-term prospects, even as they do some modest belt-tightening.

Consumers say they’re not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own fortunes still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, “there’s a new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by Wall Street bonuses,” says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied overbidding quiets. “Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three,” says John Tealdi, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their ability to find and keep a job.

Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for lower interest rates. Employers wouldn’t mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. Getting a table at Manhattan’s hot new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co. may still be worth toasting.

\51.   By “Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet” (Lines 1-2, Paragraph 1), the author means ________.

[A] Spero can hardly maintain her business

[B] Spero is too much engaged in her work

[C] Spero has grown out of her bad habit（D）

[D] Spero is not in a desperate situation

\52.   How do the public feel about the current economic situation?

[A] Optimistic.

[B] Confused.

[C] Carefree.（A）

[D] Panicked.

\53.   When mentioning “the $4 million to $10 million range” (Lines 3-4, Paragraph 3) the author is talking about ________.

[A] gold market

[B] real estate

[C] stock exchange（B）

[D] venture investment

\54.   Why can many people see “silver linings” to the economic slowdown?

[A] They would benefit in certain ways.

[B] The stock market shows signs of recovery.

[C] Such a slowdown usually precedes a boom.（A）

[D] The purchasing power would be enhanced.

\55.   To which of the following is the author likely to agree?

[A] A new boom, on the horizon.

[B] Tighten the belt, the single remedy.

[C] Caution all right, panic not.（C）

[D] The more ventures, the more chances.

Americans today don’t place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, entertainers, and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our children to get a practical education -- not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive anti-intellectualism in our schools aren’t difficult to find.

“Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual,” says education writer Diane Ravitch. “Schools could be a counterbalance.” Ravitch’s latest book, *Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms*, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for intellectual pursuits.

But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their ideas and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, “We will become a second-rate country. We will have a less civil society.”

“Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor Richard Hofstadter in *Anti-Intellectualism in American Life*, a Pulitzer-Prize winning book on the roots of anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of our history, says Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence have been considered more noble qualities than anything you could learn from a book.

Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and rigorous book learning put unnatural restraints on children: “We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.” Mark Twain’s *Huckleberry Finn* exemplified American anti-intellectualism. Its hero avoids being civilized -- going to school and learning to read -- so he can preserve his innate goodness.

Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we reluctantly admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes and imagines.

School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country’s educational system is in the grips of people who “joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility to intellect and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least intellectual promise.”

\56.   What do American parents expect their children to acquire in school?

[A] The habit of thinking independently.

[B] Profound knowledge of the world.

[C] Practical abilities for future career.（C）

[D] The confidence in intellectual pursuits.

\57.   We can learn from the text that Americans have a history of ________.

[A] undervaluing intellect

[B] favoring intellectualism

[C] supporting school reform（A）

[D] suppressing native intelligence

\58.   The views of Ravitch and Emerson on schooling are ________.

[A] identical

[B] similar

[C] complementary（D）

[D] opposite

\59.   Emerson, according to the text, is probably ________.

[A] a pioneer of education reform

[B] an opponent of intellectualism

[C] a scholar in favor of intellect（B）

[D] an advocate of regular schooling

\60.   What does the author think of intellect?

[A] It is second to intelligence.

[B] It evolves from common sense.

[C] It is to be pursued.（C）

[D] It underlies power.

The relation of language and mind has interested philosophers for many centuries. 61) The Greeks assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought, which took root in Europe long before people realized how diverse languages could be.

Only recently did linguists begin the serious study of languages that were very different from their own. Two anthropologist-linguists, Franz Boas and Edward Sapir, were pioneers in describing many native languages of North and South America during the first half of the twentieth century. 62) We are obliged to them because some of these languages have since vanished, as the peoples who spoke them died out or became assimilated and lost their native languages. Other linguists in the earlier part of this century, however, who were less eager to deal with bizarre data from “exotic” language, were not always so grateful. 63) The newly described languages were often so strikingly different from the well studied languages of Europe and Southeast Asia that some scholars even accused Boas and Sapir of fabricating their data. Native American languages are indeed different, so much so in fact that Navajo could be used by the US military as a code during World War II to send secret messages.

Sapir’s pupil, Benjamin Lee Whorf, continued the study of American Indian languages. 64) Being interested in the relationship of language and thought, Whorf developed the idea that the structure of language determines the structure of habitual thought in a society. He reasoned that because it is easier to formulate certain concepts and not others in a given language, the speakers of that language think along one track and not along another. 65) Whorf came to believe in a sort of linguistic determinism which, in its strongest form, states that language imprisons the mind, and that the grammatical patterns in a language can produce far-reaching consequences for the culture of a society. Later, this idea became to be known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, but this term is somewhat inappropriate. Although both Sapir and Whorf emphasized the diversity of languages, Sapir himself never explicitly supported the notion of linguistic determinism.

文章背景

​    本文是一篇关于青少年犯罪的文章，原文的标题是Juvenile Crime(青少年犯罪)。原文分为六个部分：Introduction(青少年犯罪介绍)；History(青少年犯罪的历史)； Juvenile Crime in the U.S.(青少年犯罪在美国的现状)；Causes of Delinquency(青少年犯罪的起因)；Treatment of Offenders(犯罪者的治疗措施)；Juvenile Crime in Other Nations(其他国家青少年犯罪介绍)。试题中的文字出自"青少年犯罪的起因"一节。

21.【解析】［C］ 语义衔接题。Theorieson the individual "……于个人的理论"。选项A. acting on 作用于; B. relying on 依赖于；C. centering on 集中于；D. commenting on 评论。前面句子…focus either on the individual or on society as the major contributing influence."许多有关青少年犯罪根源的理论或者强调个人或者强调社会作为导致犯罪的主要原因。"因此，正确答案为C。 centering on 集中于，强调个人作为导致犯罪的主要原因的理论。

22.【解析】［D］ 逻辑衔接题。…that children engage in criminal behaviorthey were not sufficiently penalized for previous misdeeds "孩子从事犯罪行为……以前的错误行为没有得到足够的惩罚。"不难发现，前后两个句子是因果关系。因此，正确答案为D。

 24.【解析】［D］ 语义衔接/ 惯用衔接题。…children commit crimes into their failure to rise above their socioeconomic status… "孩子犯罪……想提高社会经济地位却遭受失败……"。不难发现，前后两个部分之间是因果关系。选项A. in return 作为回报，一般不与to 连用；B. in reply to 作为回复；C. in reference to 关于，参考；D. in response to 由于，作为回应,这里可以引申为"由于，出于"的意思，表达一种因果关系。

 25.【解析】［A］ 逻辑衔接题。…children commit crimes in response to their failure to rise above their socioeconomic statusas a rejection of middleclass values. "孩子犯罪是因为想提高社会经济地位却遭受失败……由于他们对中产阶级的价值观念持否定态度产阶级的价值观给拒之门外"。选项A. or 或者；B. but rather 但是宁愿；C. but 但是；D. or else 然而。此处空格表达的是一种并列关系，按照对应关系此处应为or。因此，正确答案为A。

26.【解析】［B］ 语义衔接/结构衔接题。Most theories of juvenile delinquency have focused on children from disadvantaged families,the fact that children from wealthy homes also commit crimes. "大多数青少年犯罪的理论都将矛头指向单亲家庭的孩子身上，……富裕家庭孩子也犯罪的事实"。选项A. considering 考虑到； B. ignoring 忽略；C. highlighting 强调，启发；D. discarding 抛弃。 "大多数青少年犯罪的理论都将矛头指向单亲家庭的孩子身上，忽略了富裕家庭孩子也犯罪的事实"，符合句子含义。因此，正确答案为B。

27.【解析】［C］ 结构衔接题。The latter may commit crimeslack of adequate parental control. "后者也犯罪……缺少足够的父母控制。"不难发现，句子前后体现的是因果关系。因此，正确答案为C. for lack of译为"由于缺少……"。

28.【解析】［D］ 语义衔接题。本题目选择"are…to "的短语，在句子中充当谓语。句子叙述到All theories, however, are tentative and areto criticism. "然而，所有的理论都不是定论，常常……批评"。选择谓语动词，主语和宾语提供信息决定答案。选项A. be immune to 对……免疫；B. be resistant to 抵制……；C. be sensitive to 对……敏感；D. be subject to 遭受。与该空并列的形容词tentative表示"尝试性的"，因此"容易招致批评"，正确答案为D。

29.【解析】［A］ 语义衔接题。Changes in the social structure may indirectlyjuvenile crime rates. "社会结构的变革可能会间接……青少年犯罪率"。选项A. affect 影响；B. reduce 减少；C. check 检查；D. reflect 反映。因此，正确答案为A，社会结构的变革可能会间接影响青少年犯罪率。

30.【解析】［B］ 语义衔接/惯用衔接题。…changes in the economy thatto fewer job opportunities for youth and rising unemployment…"that" 指代changes in the economy，"经济的变革……年轻人就业机会少，失业率高。"选项A. point to 指向；B. lead to 导致；C. come to 达到，苏醒；D. amount to 合计，总计。经济的变革会使就业机会少，失业率高，这是因果关系。只有lead to"导致"可以表示因果关系。

31.【解析】［A］ 结构衔接题。…changes in the economymake gainful employment increasingly difficult to obtain. "经济变革……使回报丰厚的工作更难找到。" 选项A. in general 一般来说；B. on average 平均；C. by contrast 对比；D. at length 最终。句子中没有统计，因此不涉及平均， on average 不符合句子含义；没有参照对象，因此不涉及对比， by contrast 不符合句子含义；没有时间期限，不涉及最终， at length不符合句子含义。in general "一般来说，经济变革使回报丰厚的工作更难找到"，符合句子含义。因此，正确答案为A。

32.【解析】［C］ 语义衔接/惯用衔接题。本题目选择与介词in 构成的搭配，并且在句子中做状语。The resulting discontent may inlead more youths into criminal behavior. "由此而产生的不满……促使越来越多的年轻人卷入犯罪活动"。选项A. in case 万一；B. in short 简言之；C. in turn 反过来；D. in essence 本质上说。前文介绍各种变化带来的后果，空格处所在的句子"随之产生的不满……导致更多的年轻人走向犯罪"，这说明变化和犯罪是相互作用的，故选择in turn"反过来"。

33.【解析】［D］ 语义衔接/词汇辨析题。Families have alsochanges these years. "这些年来，家庭也……变化"。选项A. survived 幸存；B. noticed 注意到；C. undertaken 承担, 许诺, 担任；D. experienced 经历。"这些年来，家庭也经历了变化"，符合句子含义。因此，正确答案为D。

35.【解析】［A］ 结构衔接题。本题目选择关系代词或者关系副词或者连词，将前、后两个部分紧密连接。Children are likely to have less supervision at homewas common in the traditional family.不难发现，句子中体现了比较级,因此，正确答案为A。"与传统家庭相比，这类家庭的孩子很可能受到相对较少的管束。"本题中在than后省略了the supervision that。

36.【解析】［B］ 语义衔接题。前文提到了现代家庭的构成：More families consist of oneparent households or two working parents. 第三段首句Changes in the social structure…指出社会结构的变化影响青少年犯罪。因此structure "结构"为正确选项。system "系统"，concept "概念"，heritage "遗传"都不合文义。

37.【解析】［B］ 语义衔接/词汇辨析题。Othercauses of offensive acts include frustration or failure in school,… "其他的……导致犯罪行为的原因包括上学受挫和失败……"。选项A. assessable 可评估的；B. identifiable 能够被发现的；C. negligible可以忽略的,微不足道的；D. incredible 不可相信的。青少年犯罪的原因都是社会认同的，所以不可能是"可以忽略的,微不足道的"或者"不可相信的"。assessable不与cause搭配。因此，正确答案为B。

38.【解析】［D］ 语义衔接/词汇辨析题。Other identifiable causes of offensive acts include frustration or failure in school, the increasedof drugs and alcohol,…"其他的能够发现的导致犯罪行为的原因包括上学受挫和失败，毒品和酒类产品的……"。选项A. expense花费，支出；B. restriction 限制；C. allocation 分配；D. availability可利用性，有益，可得到的东西。本题所在的语句表述的是造成青少年犯罪的因素之一，四个选项中availability最符合题意，意为"毒品和酒越来越容易得到"。A项expense容易误选，但它表达的意思是"花费，开支"，所以不符合句义。

39.【解析】［A］ 语义衔接题。Other identifiable causes of offensive acts include frustration or failure in school, the increased availability of drugs and alcohol, the growingof child abuse and child neglect."其他的能够发现的导致犯罪行为的原因包括上学受挫和失败，毒品和酒类产品的存在，虐待孩子和忽略孩子的……越来越多。" 选项A. incidence 发生，发生率；B. awareness 意识；C. exposure 暴露；D. popularity 普及，流行。文意想要表达：虐待孩子和忽视孩子也提高了青少年犯罪率。因此正确答案为A，这些事情的发生率增长会造成更多犯罪。

40.【解析】［C］ 逻辑衔接题。本题目选择连词，将前、后两个句子紧密连接。All these conditions tend to increase the probability of a child committing a criminal act,a direct causal relationship has not yet been established. "所有的这些情况都趋向于增加青少年犯罪的可能性，……其中直接的联系还没有建立起来。"不难发现，前、后两个句子之间体现为让步关系。选项A. provided 倘若(表示条件关系)；B. since 既然(表示原因)；C. although 虽然……但是(表示让步关系)；D. supposing 假使(表示条件关系)。因此，正确答案为C。

 

 参考译文

  许多研究青少年犯罪(年轻人所犯的罪行)的理论要么强调个人，要么强调社会是导致犯罪的主要因素。以个人原因为中心的理论认为青少年从事犯罪活动是由于他们以前的恶性没有受到应有的惩罚或者是他们通过彼此的影响而学会了犯罪。关注于社会责任的理论认为青少年未能如愿地提升自己的社会经济地位，由此引发犯罪，或者是把犯罪看成是对中产阶级价值观的排斥。

  大多数有关青少年犯罪的理论强调这些儿童都是来自贫困家庭，而忽略了出身富裕家庭的孩子也会犯罪这一事实。后者可能是由于缺乏父母的管教而犯罪。不过所有的理论都不是确定的，并且都受到了批评。

  社会结构方面的变化可能间接影响了青少年的犯罪率。比如，经济领域的变化导致青少年就业机会减少和失业率上升，使得能挣钱的工作越来越难以获得。由此产生的不满就可能反过来使更多的年轻人犯罪。

  这些年，家庭也在发生着变化。单亲家庭或父母都有工作的家庭不断增加。这样一来，孩子可能在家庭受到的监督就可能比过去传统家庭要少。有人认为缺乏父母的监督会影响孩子的犯罪率。儿童犯罪的其他一些确凿原因还包括在学校的挫折与失败，药物和酒精更加容易得到，以及对孩子受到的虐待与忽视越来越多。所有这一切都会增加儿童犯罪的可能性，虽然其中的直接因果关系还不确定。

 

**Section III: Reading Comprehension**

Part A (40 points)

**Text 1** 

一、文章结构总体分析

文章介绍了一种能够帮助人们迅速找到工作的搜索代理工具。全文从一个使用搜索代理而找到工作的实例入手，对这种新事物的优缺点进行了全面分析，并引用了当事人和专家的观点。

第一段：律师雷德曼通过“个人搜索代理”顺利地找到了工作。

第二、三、四段：这种搜索代理的优点是避免了人工重复性地访问数据库，但缺点是当求职者缩小搜索条件时会失去很多机会。并且这种机械的程序缺少人性化的求职建议。因此最佳策略是把它当作一种提示性服务。比如一些网站在“代理”的程序设计上就考虑到让它吸引求职者回访网站。

第五段：“搜索代理”即使是对那些不找工作的人也有用。

二、试题具体解析 

\41. 【答案】C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。

题干中的关键信息是人名“Redmon”，文章第一段就是围绕他的个人经历而展开论述的。四个选项都提到“database”，从文章首句可知，它指的是网上的一个求职资料库。关键看雷德曼在这个资料库里做了些什么而找到工作的。文章提到，雷德曼使用资料库的“个人搜索代理”，敲入了几个关键词，几周后就得到了空缺职位的通知。接着他把个人简历用电子邮件寄给了雇主，从而获得了一份工作。C选项中的“特殊服务”指的就是网站上提供的“个人搜索代理”这种服务，虽然比较泛，但符合文意。

A选项中的“寻找空缺职位”和B选项中的“张贴相匹配的职位”都是“个人搜索代理”代替当事人做的事情。文中只提到雷德曼将个人简历电邮给雇主，因此D选项也不是他找到工作的方式。

\42. 【答案】A

​    【解析】本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。  

文章第二段一、二句谈到搜索代理的优点是：避免了人工重复性地访问数据库。连词But后，文章转而提到专家们看到了它的缺点：每缩小一次搜索条件，对求职或应聘者来说就意味着丧失了一次机会。但这个缺点在四个选项中都没有提到。搜索代理的另外一个缺点在文章中比较隐蔽，它是在第三段提到的：There’s no career counseling implicit in all of this，代词this回指前面的job searching programs，也就是搜索代理。

\43. 【答案】 D  

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：词义题。

直接定位到文章第三段，理解这个新词汇要联系其上下文。上文谈到搜索代理都不会有隐含的求职建议。instead转折之后，下文对这个词汇进行了解释：when you get E-mail, consider it a reminder to check the database again（最佳策略是把“代理”当作一种提示性服务，来及时跟踪一个特定数据库里的工作信息），tip service与reminder前后呼应。

\44. 【答案】B

【解析】本题考核的知识点是：写作意图题。

第四段第二句中的for example非常重要。考生应注意：在阅读中，举例必然是为了说明一个论点，这个论点可以在举例之前或之后指出。那么第四段举求职网的例子就是为了说明首句：Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return（一些网站在“代理”的程序设计上考虑让它诱使求职者回访网站）。接下来的内容具体说明了是怎样诱使的：求职者为了查找数据库中更多的匹配项，不得不回访这个网站。

\45. 【答案】C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。

这种题型有一定难度，它要求考生对全文有综合性的理解。因此在解题时经常是排除和定位法相结合。第五段首句提到：即使那些不找工作的人也会觉得“搜索代理”有用。因此C选项正确。文章提出了搜索代理的缺点，指出最好只是把它当作一种提示性服务，因此它不是必不可少的，排除A选项；文章只在第五段首句提到“一些人利用搜索代理（发来的电子邮件）密切关注职业市场对于自己行业的需求情况”，排除B选项；从雷德曼的经历可以知道，找到工作后还是可以继续使用搜索代理服务的，因此D选项也不对。

三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析

长难句分析：

①It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as location, title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the database.

该强调句的主干是：It is（an interactive feature ）that（lets… then E-mails…），强调主语an interactive feature。That后面连接的是两个谓语动词结构：let sb. do sth.和名词活用为动词的E-mails。Such as…结构举例说明job criteria，when引导的时间状语从句修饰整个句子。

②Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database; when you get E-rnail, consider it a reminder to check the database again. 

该句子分号前后是两个分句，后一分句对前一分句作进一步解释。前一分句的主干是：the best strategy is to use the agent，as…介词短语结构意为“当做……”。不定式结构“to keep…”表示目的。

③When CareerSite’s agent sends out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only three potential jobs—those it considers the best matches. 

for example点明了这个句子和前一句之间的关系：举例说明前面一句话。该句子的主干是：it includes three potential jobs。When引导时间状语从句。破折号后是potential jobs的同位语，中心词是those，后面接定语从句。句之中的it回指CareerSite’s agent。

④Some use them to keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on compensation to arm themselves when negotiating for a raise. 

该句子的主干是Some use them，两个并列的不定式结构to keep…or gather…在句子中做目的状语。在第二个目的状语中又含有一个表目的的不定式短语to arm…。

佳句赏析：

Redmon maintains his agent at CareerBuilder. “You always keep your eyes open,” he says. Working with a personal search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for you. 

在这组句子中使用了keep one’s eyes open这个习惯表达。由于该短语非常形象化，作者又再次使用了eyes这个形象having another set of eyes looking out for you，来表达人们应该时刻关注新的信息。

四、全文翻译

去年末，甘特•雷德曼律师在找工作时偶然发现网上有一个被称作“职业建筑师”的求职资料库。他找来找去，没有找到需要的工作，但却被该网站上的“个人搜索代理”所吸引。其特点是互动性，这样访问者就可敲入一些和工作标准相关的关键词，如：地点、职位和薪水等等，然后当资料库里出现了相匹配的职位时，“代理”就会把这些信息用电子邮件发出去。（长难句①）雷德曼选择了关键词“法律”、“知识产权”和“华盛顿”。过了三个星期后，雷德曼接到了第一个职位空缺的通知。他说，“我挖到金子了”。他把个人简历用电子邮件寄给了雇主，接着就得到了一份驻公司律师的职务。

由于网上的求职招聘网站数不胜数，因此寻找可能的空缺职位变得费时又费力。而“搜索代理”避免了人工重复性地访问数据库。不过，虽然有一个“搜索代理”已成功地为雷德曼找到了工作，就业专家们还是指出了“搜索代理”存在的问题。比如缩小搜索条件很可能对求职或应聘者不利。一位专家说，“你每回答一个问题就丧失了一次机会”。

寻找任何职业，都得从一个窄的概念出发，即你想要干什么，然后再去扩大它。“而这是任何程序所无法做到的”，另一位专家说，“程序都不会有隐含的求职建议”。实际上，最佳策略是把“代理”当作一种提示性服务，来及时跟踪一个特定数据库里的工作信息。当你收到电子邮件时，把它看作是提醒你该去查一查资料库的新信息了。（长难句②）一本求职指南的作者这样说到，“我不愿意依赖‘代理’，它只是在数据库里逐一寻找可能让我感兴趣的新东西”。

一些网站在“代理”的程序设计上考虑让它诱使求职者回访网站。比如，当这些求职网站的“代理”向注册用户发送信息时，只提供三种它认为最匹配的工作。（长难句③）而实际上，数据库里可能还有更多的匹配项，于是，求职者只得再次访问这个网站来寻找。事实上，求职者真的这样做。求职网销售副总裁塞思•皮茨说，“在我们发送新信息的当天网站访问量就会急剧上升”。

即使那些不找工作的人也会觉得“搜索代理”有用。一些人利用搜索代理密切关注职业市场对于自己行业的需求情况，或者收集有关薪水的信息以便和老板协商加薪时有所准备。（长难句④）雷德曼虽然已经愉快地就业了，但他依然保持着与“职业建筑师”网“代理”的联系。他说，“你要时刻睁大眼睛，关注这方面的信息”。使用“个人搜索代理”就意味着多了一双眼睛在为你观察留心。（佳句）

**Text 2**

一、文章结构总体分析

文章介绍了社会上存在的一种隐蔽的不平等现象：按字母排序。作者采用了下定义、举例子、假设等多种写作手法，详细透彻地分析了一个我们也许从未意识到的社会问题。

第一段：给“字母排序现象”下定义：对那些姓氏字母在字母表中排得靠后的人的歧视。

第二、三段：举例说明社会上存在的字母排序现象。

第四段：提出一种理论来解释字母排序现象的起源。

第五段：进一步举例说明字母排序现象在人类生活中普遍存在。

二、试题具体解析 

\46. 【答案 】A

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：写作意图题。

根据题干中给出的信息“AAAA cars” 和“Zodiac cars”迅速定位到文章第二段首句：当乘客翻电话薄叫出租车时，一家名为“AAAA汽车”的出租车公司远比另一家名为“Zodiac汽车”的公司占有优势。注意作者举例一般是为了说明一个问题，并且这个问题会在其前后阐释出来。该例子下文是另外一个例子；上文即第一段则是对字母排序，一种隐蔽的不公平现象的定义。因此作者举出这个例子的目的就是说明第一段的主题：存在一种字母排序的不公平现象。原文中的insidious和unaware对应题干中的overlooked，discrimination对应inequality。B选项错在conspicuous，C选项错在personal prejudice，本文讨论的是社会问题。D选项很有迷惑性，但作者的写作意图绝不是只限于讨论品牌，而是字母排序的社会现象。

47.【答案】 D

【解析】本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。

综合文章前三段的内容。第一段提出现象：存在一种隐蔽的不公平待遇，叫字母排序。第二段举例说明：“AAAA汽车”比“Zodiac汽车”有优势；名为Adam或 Abbott的人在生活中要比名为Zoe或Zysman的人有优势；大部分杰出人物的姓氏字母都排在了A到K之间。第三段进一步举例说明字母排序现象在名人身上的体现，如：美国的总统和副总统、七个富裕国的政府首脑、世界三大重要银行家、最富裕的五个人，他们的姓氏字母都排在前面。

文章并没有拿东西方做比较，而只谈英语名字的字母排序现象，因此可排除A选项；文章前三段的举例中只提到很多杰出人物的姓氏字母都在前面，无法推出B选项；C选项有迷惑性，从汽车出租公司的例子确实可以推出，顾客注意到了出租车公司的名字。但并不能由此就推出顾客总是很注意公司的名字，often一词用得太绝对。从三段整体来看，从insidious form 和Less well known等处可以推出D选项为最佳答案。

\48. 【答案】 C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。

第四段开始作者探讨了造成字母排序现象的原因：幼儿园的老师把学生按姓氏的字母顺序从前往后排座位，因此一些近视的、姓氏字母排后的学生很少被老师提问，结果是这些孩子能力差，公开表达自己时缺乏信心。

文章暗示的是老师经常向坐在前面的学生，即姓氏字母顺序靠前的学生提问，而不是A选项，选项B、D无从推起，只有选项C比较符合逻辑，因为文章一开始就谈到按字母排序是一种潜在的不公平现象。当作者提到这种做法导致儿童受教育的机会不平等时，当然是在暗示老师们该关注一下那些在字母排序中处于劣势的学生了。

 

49．【答案】B

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：解读文化代码题。

直接定位到第五段第二句：在大学毕业典礼上，姓氏字母排前的学生先领到毕业证，而轮到那些姓氏字母靠后的人时，大多数参加者差不多都在……了。理解的关键是ZZZ，它是拟声词，表示打鼾声。它经常作为符号出现在一些漫画中，比如：瑞星杀毒软件中就有只狮子发出“ZZZZ”声的画面，表示它在酣睡。这个题目是考研阅读中首次考查学生透过语言符号代码，解读文化的能力。它也在提示考生平日学习中要多了解英语文化背景知识。

\50. 【答案】 D

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。

纵观全文，文章首段定义字母排序为一种隐蔽的不公平待遇。第二、三段举例说明杰出人物多为姓氏字母排序靠前的人。第四段直接指出，字母排序造成了儿童受教育机会的不平等。第五段又列举了生活中更多其他的不平等现象。由此可见，D选项符合文意，是全文要表达的信息。

文章只是泛泛提到姓氏字母排序靠后的人处于劣势，并没有具体到从哪个字母开始，A选项不正确。在这篇文章里，作者只停留在提出一种不公平的现象，并举例、分析其原因，而没有涉及消除它是否很困难。因此C选项错误。文章中虽然提到，很多杰出人物在姓氏字母排序中靠前，但这只是说明字母排序靠前的人可能更容易成功，并且这种现象是隐蔽而不易被察觉的。B选项虽然似是而非，但在文章中找不到充分论据。

三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析

长难句分析：

① This, for those as yet unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet. 

该句子的主干是this refers to discrimination。主语this和谓语refers to之间插入了介词短语for those作状语，those后跟着形容词短语unaware of…做定语，直译为：“对于那些（还没有意识到存在这种不公平待遇的）人来说”；宾语discrimination后跟介词短语against those作定语，those后又有whose引导的定语从句，直译为：“[对那些（姓氏字母在字母表中排得靠后）的人]的歧视”。

② Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C respectively; and 26 of George Bush's predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half.

该句子的主干是由and连接的两个分句，即American president and vice-president have surnames, and 26 of… had surnames。第一个分句的宾语surnames后是分词结构starting with作定语，直译为“美国的总统和副总统有（分别以B和C字母开头的）姓氏”；第二个分句宾语后紧跟的介词结构in the first half of the alphabet作定语，直译为“乔治•布什的祖先中，26位有（排在字母表前半部分的）姓氏”，另外一个介词结构against…的完整形式是against just 16 of George Bush's predecessors had surnames in the second half，直译为“相对只有16位有（排在字母表后半部分的）姓氏”。

③ Shortlists for job interviews, election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all tend to be drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they plough through them. （长难句）

该句子的主干是and连接的两个分句：all tend to be drawn up, and their recipients lose interest。冒号前的三个名词短语是第一个分句主语all的同位语。As引导的时间状语从句，修饰第二个分句。

佳句赏析：

As are the world’s five richest men. 

从这句话里考生可以学会as的用法。如这篇文章的第四段一样，作者列举了一系列名人的姓氏字母在排序中占据优势的现象。为了避免重复，作者不断变换表达方式，到最后用了一个as也可以达到同样的目的：starting with B and C…in the first half of the alphabet…are alphabetically advantaged…close to the top of the alphabet…as…。但注意，这时为了保持句子平衡，要采用倒装的句式。

四、全文翻译

在过去的一个世纪里，各种各样的不平等待遇和歧视都已经受到人们的谴责或被视为违法。但是，有一种隐蔽的不公平待遇却继续盛行：字母排序。对于那些还没有意识到存在这种不公平待遇的人，可以这么向他们解释：它指的是歧视那些姓氏字母在字母表中排得靠后的人。（长难句①）

人们早就知道，当乘客翻电话薄叫出租车时，一家名为“AAAA汽车”的出租车公司远比另一家名为“Zodiac汽车”的公司占有优势。而少为人知的是，名为Adam或 Abbott的人在生活中要比名为Zoe或Zysman的人有优势。英语名字在字母表的前、后部分是很均匀地分布的，但令人不敢相信的是大部分的杰出人物的姓氏字母却都排在了A到K之间。

因此，美国的总统和副总统的姓氏字母分别以B和C开头，而乔治•布什的祖先中，有26位姓氏字母排在了字母表的前半部分，只有16位排在了后半部分。（长难句②）更令人吃惊的是，七个富裕国的政府首脑中，六位具有字母排序的优势，他们分别是：贝波鲁斯科尼、布莱尔、布什、希拉克、科利汀和小泉。世界三大中央银行行长的姓氏也排在了字母表前面，即使其中一位用的是日本名字，他们分别是：格林斯潘、迪森伯格和河野。世界上最富裕的五个人也是这样，（佳句）他们的名字分别是：盖茨、巴菲特、艾伦、埃利森和阿尔布雷克特。

难道这仅仅只是巧合吗？有一种理论是那些在字母排序中处于劣势的人闲暇之余臆造出来的。它认为这种不平等待遇早就存在了。在幼儿园的第一学期里，老师把学生按姓氏的字母顺序从前往后排座位，以便更容易记住他们的名字。因此一些近视的、姓氏字母排后的学生就固定在后面几排了。而一些粗心的老师很少向这些孩子提问，提问其实有利于他们智力的提高。这时，这些字母排序中处于劣势的孩子还认为自己有幸逃脱了提问。然而，结果却造成了能力的差异，因为这些孩子受到的关注要少，在公开表达自己时更缺乏信心。

还有这种让人感到羞辱的情况。在大学毕业典礼上，姓氏字母排前的学生先得到奖励，而轮到那些姓氏字母靠后的人时，大多数参加者差不多都在打鼾了。在求职面试的最后名单里，在投票选举单上，在与会发言人和参加者名单中……往往都是按照字母先后顺序的排列，等到拿着这些名单的人费劲地从头看到尾时，他们早已经失去了兴趣。（长难句③）

**Text 3**

一、文章结构总体分析

结构分析：

本文从斯珀若的例子展开讨论，论述了美国当前经济形势下，消费者没有表现出恐慌。论证过程中用了举例、列举、引用等论证手段。

第一段：以美甲师斯珀若的情况为典型事例，说明美国的经济情况影响到了很多人的生活。

第二段：使用列举的方法说明美国经济在降温，但段落后半部分笔锋一转，点明人们并不恐慌。

第三段：使用房地产业为典型事例，说明段首的主题句：人们自己财富的感觉依然良好。

第四段：在此使用列举的方法说明段首的主题句：人们从这次经济滑坡中看到了自己可以得到的好处。

二、试题具体解析

\51. 【答案】 D

【解析】本题考核的知识点是：词义句意题。

此句主要考对“bite one’s nails”的理解，从字面上看，意思是“咬指甲”，似乎应该选C。但是，这类型题目往往不是考查本意，因此必须放在原文中推敲。第一段第二句接着说“这个47岁的美甲师修剪、锉磨、上油的指甲却没有自己希望的那样多了”，后来又说她的生意不如从前。因此，从第二句开始讲的是经济影响到了她的生意状况。在第一句中,作者借用了 not bite one’s nails 这个形象的比喻来说明斯珀若并非 “处于非常糟糕的情况”。第一句和第二句之间的连接是but，表转折，由此可知第一句的意思是在铺垫和让步，即“虽然她的状况还不是特别差”。D选项符合此意。

\52. 【答案】 A

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。

文章第二段先列举了一些经济形势不好的例子，然后在后半段开始谈及公众对此的看法：“不过，目前还不必拉响警报。消费者好像仅仅是中度关注，没有恐慌，很多人说，即使当他们稍微勒紧裤腰带的时候，他们对经济的远景还是乐观的。”因此A选项符合文意。

也可以使用排除法：B和D可以首先排除，因为被作者在文中直接否定了。从mildly concerned 和do some modest belt-tightening等处，可以看出公众对于目前的状况态度虽然算不上极度恐慌，但也不是无忧无虑的，因此，C选项错误。但是，考生需要意识到，A选项并不是 mildly concerned 最直接的近义词，而仅比C选项更加接近而已。

\53. 【答案】 B

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：词义句意题。

第三段第二句提到“大部分地区房价保持稳定”，接着文章开始分别介绍曼哈顿和旧金山的情况，可见这两个都是例证，主要谈论的是房地产业。那么，其中引用的话语也应该是围绕这个主题展开的。如果有考生不知道房地产的英语单词，继续往下看的时候，发现John Tealdi的同位语是a Bay Area real-estate broker（一名海湾地区房地产经纪人），因而正确答案为B。

A选项是借用了文中的gold rush而捏造的干扰项。C选项看似正确，但注意它和房地产业间的关系是：由于房价稳定，股票才会攀升，股票持有者才会获利，因此文中谈论股市还是为了说明房地产业。D选项文中没有提及。

\54. 【答案】A

【解析】本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。

文章最后一段首句出现了题干中的这句话，紧接着作者使用罗列的手法举例证明：买房人会因低利率而高兴；雇主不介意人才市场少点泡沫；投资者把股市波动看作繁荣必不可少的一部分；就餐者也可以去以前上不起的饭馆。从这些事实中我们可以引申出，“银色的衬里”的意思是他们得到了好处，因此，正确答案为A选项。其他三个选项中均没有提及。

知识点补充：silver linings来自一句谚语Every cloud has a silver lining，意思是“黑暗中总有一线光明”或“情况总会好转”。文中借用silver linings来表示“人们依然看到希望”。

\55. 【答案】C

【解析】本题考核的知识点是：作者观点题。

这篇文章主要涉及美国经济，开篇以一个事例引出讨论题目：美国经济滑坡。紧接着第二段谈到，格林斯潘承认美国经济开始降温之前，人们就感觉到了经济在滑坡。在该段的后半部分，作者谈到消费者仅是中度关注而没有恐慌。第三段延续第二段后半部分，讨论消费者没有处于绝望境地。最后一段说他们在经济滑坡中还得到很多实惠。综合全文，C选项最能反应出作者的态度。A和B选项的态度分别过于乐观和悲观。D选项不符文意。

三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析

长难句分析:

① Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy’s long-term prospects even as they do some modest belt-tightening.

该句是一个并列句,and 后面的分句比较复杂,主干为 many say… ,后接的宾语从句中主干为 they remain optimistic about … ,even as 引导让步状语从句。 

 ② Many consumers seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary ingredient to a sustained boom.

该句的主干是 Many consumers seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, 之后 which 引导一个定语从句,修饰stock-market swings,其中 “view…as …” 这个短语的意思是是“把……当作/看作……”。

佳句赏析：

① Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last year's pace. 

该句中有一个很简略的表达off，意思为减少，这个表达完全可用于写作。例如：The number of applicants is 6 thousand，off from 7 thousand of last year.(申请者的数量从去年的7万人降到了今年的6万。这里用pace而不是speed表示“速度”也更加形象化。

② Home prices are holding steady in most regions.

该句的意思是：大部分地区房价保持稳定。其中，表示“保持”一般我们用remain，但是没有hold形象。

③ Diners might see an upside, too.

Upside本意为上下倒置，这里用来形容巨大的变化，导致现在情况与以前截然不同。如：We see an upside in his behavior（我们看到他现在的行为截然不同与以前/他与以前判若两人）。

四、全文翻译

   当经济发展减缓时，艾伦•斯珀若还没有处于绝望的状态。然而，“这个47岁的美甲师修剪、锉磨、上油的指甲却没有自己希望的那样多了。她大多数的客户每周花十二至五十美元，然而上个月两个老顾客突然不来了。斯珀若将之归结于疲软的经济。“我是一个准确的经济晴雨表”，她说，“我提供的服务在人们考虑省钱时就不需要了。” 因此，斯珀若也在节约开支。她改去克利兰德郊区她家附近的迪拉德百货商场购物，而不再去奈曼•马克尔斯了。“我不知道其他的客户是否也会弃我而去。”

甚至在艾伦•格林斯潘承认美国过热的经济开始降温之前，众多的工人自己已经看到了经济减速的迹象。随着消费者削减开支，从汽车销售商到Gap名牌专卖店，销售量开始几个月来连续下降。对于零售商来说，在去年感恩节和圣诞节期间的收入为全年收入的百分之二十四，对他们来讲，顾客的这种谨慎态度可是发生在节骨眼上。据专家称，今年的假日消费速度和去年相比已经减缓了百分之七。（佳句①）不过，目前还不必拉响警报。消费者好像仅仅是中度关注，没有恐慌，很多人说，即使当他们稍微勒紧裤腰带的时候，他们对经济的远景还是乐观的。（长难句①）

消费者说，尽管报纸的头条新闻很吓人，他们之所以没有绝望，其原因在于他们对自己的财产状况仍然感觉良好。大部分地区房价保持稳定。（佳句②）在曼哈顿，“又出现了新一轮的淘金热，总值达到四百万至一千万美元。这笔资金主要是由华尔街股票红利注入。” 股票经纪人芭芭拉•可考恩说。在旧金山，高价抢购现象虽然已经平息，房价却依旧看涨。“你现在只能在两三套房子间选择了，而不是二十或三十套。”海湾地区房地产经纪人约翰•梯尔迪说道。而且大多数人仍然有能力找到并且保持一份工作，他们对此颇为满足。

许多人从经济减缓中获得了好处。潜在的买房人会因低利率而高兴。雇主不介意人才市场有点泡沫。尽管很多消费者似乎一直受到股票市场波动的影响，投资者却把这种波动看作持续繁荣必不可少的一个因素。（长难句②）就餐者从中也得到很大的益处。（佳句③）过去，在曼哈顿新开的火爆的阿兰•杜卡斯饭店吃上一桌是不可能的，而现在情形大不相同。就凭这个，也值得格林斯潘和商业举杯。

\56. 【答案】 C

【解析】本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。

根据第一段第三句话“即使我们的学校也只是我们送孩子去接受实用教育（a practical education）——而不是为了知识而求知（pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge）的地方”，可以得出正确答案为C。文章多次提到学校忽视了才智教育的观点，仅从pervasive anti-intellectualism就可判断出D选项错误。A和B选项和实用教育是相违背的，而且文中也没有提及，因此不正确。

\57. 【答案】 A

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：事实细节题。

根据标志词“history”，可以定位在第四段。文章大部分都在讨论学校教育，只有第四段谈到了美国的历史。霍夫斯坦特教授在他的一本书中探讨了美国政治、宗教和教育领域中反才智主义的根源。他指出“从美国历史一开始，对民主和平民主义的追求驱使我们拒绝任何带有精英优越论味道的东西。实用、常识、先天的智力被认为是比书本中学到的东西更加高尚的素质”。可见，“精英优越论味道的东西”在这里指的就是才智主义。因此，美国有史以来就是反对才智主义的，正确答案为最接近的A选项。B、D选项和事实相反。C和本文无关，可首先排除。

\58. 【答案】D

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。

考生关键要把握这两个人各自的观点。第二段出现的拉维奇指出：学校一直处于一个重实际而轻才智的社会，但学校原本可以成为一种抗衡力。他在书中追溯学校反才智主义的根由并做出结论：美国学校没有逆转美国人对才智追求的厌恶。可见，拉维奇对学校教育的观点是：学校本来是追求才智的，但是无法扭转社会重实际而轻才智的趋势。第五段出现的爱默生则认为，学校教育和严格的课本学习不自然地禁锢了孩子。在学校里学上五到十年，结果满肚子单词（a bellyful of words），什么事情都不知道（do not know a thing）。由此可知两人的观点立场完全不同，应选D选项。

\59. 【答案】 B

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：推理引申题。

和上题一样，从第五段可推知，爱默生对学校教育持否定态度，而这种学校教育就是才智教育，与实用、常识和先天聪明（第四段最后一句）不同。因此正确答案应该是B选项。

答题技巧：首先本文是关于才智主义的，里面列举的人物肯定和才智有关，可以把答案确定在B和C两个选项内。接下来，考生需要推断的就是爱默生对才智主义是支持还是反对。

\60. 【答案】C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：作者观点题。

从文中第一段开始，作者提出问题：才智在美国教育中被忽视，进而讨论这种趋势的影响和原因，其中引用了正反很多人的观点来表明自己的态度。如厄尔•绍利斯、霍夫斯坦特和拉维奇等。文章最后指出，学校依然不信任才智，因为学校掌握在敌视才智的人手中，他们急于把自己和那些最没有才智的学生联系在一起。综合全文可知，作者从头至尾一直在批判学校和社会忽视或轻视才智的做法，因此C选项是他的观点。

 

 

三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析

长难句分析：

① Ravitch’s latest book. Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for intellectual pursuits. 

​    句子的主干是Ravitch’s latest book…traces the roots…。Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms是书的同位语，concluding引导的是状语，其中anything but的意思是“恰恰不是，根本不”。如：I was anything but happy about going.（我根本不喜欢去）。

② “Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor Richard Hofstadter in Anti-intellectualism in American Life, a Pulitzer-Prize winning book on the roots of anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. 

句子主干为一个直接引语， “Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor Richard Hofstadter。后面连接的in Anti-intellectualism in American Life 作状语，斜体部分为书名，和Pulitzer-Prize winning book为同位语，on表示“以……为主题”。

佳句赏析：

① From the beginning of our history, says Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of elitism. 

​    Urge一般用作动词表“督促，驱使”，这里用作名词，意思是“强烈要求”，加上drive（驱使）和smell of（有…的味道），三个词都是熟悉的词汇，但用在这里都非常形象化。平时在一些简单的句子中使用这些表达，例如：the urges for a stable society (对社会稳定的强烈要求)；The desire for success has driven him to work day and night （成功的愿望驱使他夜以继日地工作）；His words smell of challenge（他的话有一些挑战的味道），等等。

② Intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes, and imagines. 

While前后连接两个句子，进行比较或作轻微的转折，语义上相当于yet，但用法更为讲究，前后两句往往意思相反，结构相似。

例句补充：The young sees every rising sun as a day added to his life, while the old regards it as 24 hours eliminated from his life （年轻人把朝阳看作生命中的又一天，而老年人则把它看作生命中又流逝了24小时）。

四、全文翻译

今天的美国人对才智并不十分重视。我们心目中的英雄不是学者，而是运动员、演艺界人士和企业家。即使我们的学校也只是我们送孩子去接受实用教育，而不是为了知识而求知的地方。学校中也不难发现反才智主义的普遍存在。

“学校一直处于一个重实际而轻才智的社会中。”教育作家戴安•拉维奇说。“学校原本可以成为一种抗衡力。拉维奇的新书《落后：一个世纪失败的学校改革》追溯了学校里反才智主义的根由，并得出结论：美国学校绝没有逆转美国人对才智追求的厌恶。（长难句①）

​    然而，学校原本可以并且也应该做到这一点的。鼓励孩子们排斥精神生活，会使他们很容易被利用和控制。如果缺乏批判地思考、捍卫自己的思想和理解他人观点的能力，他们就不能够完全参与到我们的民主当中去。作家厄尔•绍利斯说：“沿着这种路线走下去，我们会变成一个二流国家。我们社会的民族程度将会降低。

​    “才智被看作一种权利和特权而遭到厌弃，”历史学家理查德•霍夫斯坦特教授在《美国生活中的反才智主义》中这样写道。这本曾获普利策奖的书探讨了美国政治、宗教和教育领域中反才智主义的根源。（长难句②）霍夫斯坦特说，在我们历史的一开始，我们对于民主和平民主义的渴望驱使我们拒绝任何带有精英优越论味道的东西。（佳句①）实用、常识、先天的智力被认为是比书本中学到的东西更加高尚的素质。

拉尔夫•沃尔朵•爱默生和其他一些先验主义哲学家认为学校教育和严格的课本学习不自然地禁锢了孩子。“我们被关在中小学和大学里背诵了十到十五年。出来之后装满了一肚子的单词，却什么也不懂。”马克•吐温写的《哈克贝利芬历险记》即展现了美国的反才智主义。这本书的主角拒绝变成文明人，即：不上学，不学习读书写字。这样他就能保存自己善良的本性。

按照霍夫斯坦特的观点，才智同我们所赞赏的那种天生的智力有所不同。才智指的是人精神世界中批判、创造和思考的一面。智力寻求的是理解、运用、整合和调节，而才智是审视、思考、怀疑、形成理论、批判和想象。（佳句②）

学校仍然是一个才智受到怀疑的地方。霍夫斯坦特说我们国家的教育体制掌握在这样一群人的手中，“他们沾沾自喜地、霸气十足地公然宣称他们对才智的敌意，也迫不急待地表示出对那些在才智上没有前途的孩子们的认同。”

**Part B**

 (61) The Greeks assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought, which took root in Europe long before people realized how diverse languages could be.

【解析】  本题考核的知识点是：多重复合句的译法

该句子是复杂的复合句，其结构可以分三层。第一层是含非限定性定语从句的复合句，主干是The Greeks assumed sth., which took root…。其中Which引导定语从句，代表前面的观点sth.，因此直接译成“这种观点”；第二层是含宾语从句的主句+含时间状语从句的非限定性定语从句，主句中that引导宾语从句做宾语，定语从句中long before引导时间状语从句做状语。第三层是含宾语从句的时间状语从句，其中how diverse languages could be做realized的宾语。

词汇：assume 意为“假定，设想，猜测，认为”，在句子中译为“认为”更符合汉语习惯；some 译为“某种”，表示不确定；take root 的意思是“扎根，生根”；long before，意为“早在……之前就……”；diverse的意思是“不同的，变化多的”，在句子中通过词类转换，译成“语言的千差万别”。

译文：希腊人认为语言的结构和思维过程有某种联系，这种观点早在人们意识到语言的千差万别之前就已经在欧洲扎下了根。

(62) We are obliged to them because some of these languages have since vanished, as the peoples who spoke them died out or became assimilated and lost their native languages.

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：短语be obliged to、多重复合句的译法

该句也是复杂的复合句，其结构分三层。第一层是含原因状语从句的复合句，主干是We are obliged to them because …，because引导原因状语从句。第二层是because原因状语从句中套as原因状语从句，从句的主干是these languages have since vanished, as…。第三层是as原因状语从句中套定语从句，主干是peoples (who spoke them )died out or became assimilated and lost…。其中定语从句who spoke them限定先行词people，做主语；谓语是or连接的两个并列部分，其中第二部分又是and连接的两个动作。全句翻译的时候非常重要的一点就是排序，原因状语放在主句前后均可，状语从句内部最好先翻译as引导的从句。同时也要注意一些细节，如since，or。

词汇：be obliged to 通常的意思是“不得不”，这里是一个不太常见的意思“感谢”，可以从上下文中推出；since 意为“从此之后”；vanish 的意思是“消失”；assimilate的意思是“同化，吸收”。

译文：我们得感谢他们，因为在此之后，随着说这些语言的人消亡或者被同化而失去母语，这些语言中有一些就此消失了。

(63) The newly described languages were often so strikingly different from the well studied languages of Europe and Southeast Asia that some scholars even accused Boas and Sapir of fabricating their data.

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：so…that结构、短语accuse sb. of sth.、过去分词做定语的译法

句子的主干是languages were often so …that …，其中that引导结构状语从句。有两个过去分词作定语：newly described和well studied，因为较短，可直接译为定语。主句谓语部分were often so strikingly different from有两种处理方法：一种是保留原文词性，译为“如此显著地不同于”；第二种是改变词性，将different变为名词，strikingly变为形容词，全句结构为“……和……的区别如此显著，以至于……”。后者更加符合汉语的习惯。

词汇：strikingly意为“显著地”；accuse意为“指责；指控”，本句选择前一个词义“指责”；fabricate的意思是“捏造”，考生即使不知道这个词义，也可以根据上下文推出。

译文：新近被描绘的语言与过去已经得到充分研究的欧洲及东南亚语言之间的区别如此显著，以至于一些学者甚至指责博厄斯和萨皮尔捏造数据。

(64) Being interested in the relationship of language and thought, Whorf developed the idea that the structure of language determines the structure of habitual thought in a society.

【解析】本题考核的知识点是：非谓语结构作状语和同位语从句的译法

句子的主干是Whorf developed the idea that …，that引导同位语从句。主句中又有Being interested in the relationship of language and thought这个现在分词结构作原因状语，翻译时可以把句子主语提前，译为主谓句，但需要加一个连词，表明和主句的因果关系，这里可以加“因为……所以”，“以至”或“结果”。that引导的同位语从句的处理方法可以是“这样的”，或用“那就是”、“即”等表达后，重新组织句子。

词汇：developed 与idea搭配，不宜译作“发展”，可译为“得出”；determine意为“决定”；habitual的意思是“习惯的”。

译文：沃尔夫对语言和思维的关系很感兴趣，结果他得出这样的观点：语言的结构决定一个社会习惯思维的结构。

(65) Whorf came to believe in a sort of linguistic determinism which, in its strongest form, states that language imprisons the mind, and that the grammatical patterns in a language can produce far-reaching consequences for the culture of a society.

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：定语从句、宾语从句的译法

该句子分两个层次。第一层是含定语从句的主句，其主干是Whorf came to believe in a sort of linguistic determinism which …，which引导定语从句修饰linguistic determinism。第二层是含有两个并列的宾语从句的定语从句，主干是which states that …and that…，两个that引导宾语从句。

词汇：come to 表达一种转变，可译为“逐渐、进而”；determinism意为“决定论”或“决定主义”；in its strongest form 按汉语习惯可译作“其极端的形式”；imprison的本义是“监禁”，这里可以引申为“限制、禁锢”等；far-reaching与consequences连用，可译为“深远的影响”。

译文：沃尔夫逐渐相信某种语言决定论，该理论最极端的形式声称，语言限制思想，并且，语言的语法结构可对一个社会的文化产生深远的影响。

三、参考译文

几百年来，哲学家一直对语言与思维的关系很感兴趣。（41）希腊人认为语言的结构和思维过程有某种联系，这种观点早在人们意识到语言的千差万别之前就已经在欧洲扎下了根。

直到最近，语言学家才开始研究与自己母语不同的语言。两位人类学语言学家，佛瑞兹•博厄斯和爱德华•萨皮尔是两位先驱，他们在20世纪前半叶描述了南美洲和北美洲很多土著语言。（42）我们得感谢他们，因为在此之后，随着说这些语言的人消亡或者被同化而失去母语，这些语言中有一些就此消失了。然而，他们同时代那些对“异国”语言的奇怪数据无甚兴趣的语言学家，却并不总是心怀感激。（43）新近被描绘的语言与过去已经得到充分研究的欧洲及东南亚语言之间的区别如此显著，以至于一些学者甚至指责博厄斯和萨皮尔捏造数据。印第安语言的确非常不同，以至于二战期间，美国军队发送秘密情报的时候，使用纳瓦霍语作为密码。

萨皮尔的学生本杰明•李•沃尔夫继续研究美洲印第安语言。（44）沃尔夫对语言和思维的关系很感兴趣，结果他得出这样的观点：语言的结构决定一个社会习惯思维的结构。他推理说，在一个特定的语言中，形成某些概念相对比较容易，但形成另一些概念就不同了，说这种语言的人沿着一个轨迹思维，而不是另外一个轨迹。（45）沃尔夫逐渐相信某种语言决定论，该理论最极端的形式声称，语言限制思想，并且，语言的语法结构可对一个社会的文化产生深远的影响。后来，这种观点被称为萨皮尔—沃尔夫假说，但是这个说法并不恰当。尽管萨皮尔和沃尔夫都强调语言的多样性，但是萨皮尔从来没有公开支持语言决定论这种概念。

Section IV: Writing (20 points)

一、审题谋篇

本题为图画加提纲式作文。

从近10年的命题趋势来看，图表、图画作文已经成为主要的命题方式。从命题者的角度来说，这是为了更好地考查考生的写作能力，如：理解、推断和书面组织、表达能力。学生想要通过押题、背作文模版来应付图画作文是不可能得高分的。审题在图画型作文方面尤为重要。比如2004年的这幅图画。由于指导语中没有给出确定的题目，很多考生花了很长时间来琢磨主题，我们来看这幅图画：一个赛跑者正满头大汗地、面带微笑地跑向终点。可是当他刚刚踏上终点线时，跑道上的标志表明这个终点又是一个新的起点。那么我们从图画中可以读出什么样的启示呢？让我们的思维离开图画的直观内容，联想自己的生活时，最容易想到的是求学生活。想到这里，考生接着就应该由己推彼，联系现实生活和历史长河中更有说服力的实例。比如：我国载人飞船胜利到达太空这个终点，标志着我国航空探索事业的一个新起点。居里夫人如果满足于自己第一次取得的成就，就不会两次获得诺贝尔奖等等。

​    接下来考生应按照题目要求，规划文章的结构。文章必须包括三个方面的内容：（1）描述图画；（2）诠释图画所传达的内涵；（3）用实例来论证自己的观点。文章可以分三段完成：首段对图画进行客观描述；第二段需要阐释图画的深层含义，也就是点出主题，如：The ending point is a new starting point或Ending means beginning或Pursuit is endless等。无限循环的赛跑代表了人生。一个个终点是短期设定的目标，当它们一一被实现后，接下来的不是停止，而是更多、更高的目标；人类求知的道路是没有终点的，每一个新的突破就是一个新的起点。第三段列举实例对前面的观点加以论证。举例要有说服力，要切合主题。最好能举出两至三个例子。文章结尾处，考生最好用一两句简洁的话语重申观点，总结全文。 

二、参考范文

The Ending Point: a New Starting Line

As is shown in the picture, a runner is dashing to the finishing line, with smile and sweat on his face. When he is congratulating himself on finishing such a task, there are two huge Chinese characters, which read “Starting Point”, in front of the line.   

From the drawing we can easily define what the author of the drawing tries to reveal to us: a finishing line always leads to another starting point. This is true not only in a race, but also in one’s life. One track represents no more than one stage in the process of life, while the finishing line is merely the realization of one short-term goal. Therefore, this line rather marks the starting of another race than announces the finishing of one. 

This drawing reminds me of a lot of stimulating stories. The most persuasive example is the discovery of radium by Madame Curie, which is regarded as the long-awaited final answer to the mystery of radiation. On the other hand, it triggers off the study of other radioactive elements and their applications, which starts a brand new chapter in physics. Another example that occurs to me is the safe return of Shenzhou V spaceship, which marks the triumphant end of the launch and at the same time, begins a new era for China's space exploration. A third example is relevant to ourselves. Four years' college life is now approaching an end and each of us is standing at a new starting point, either pursuing further study or starting a career. Only when we are well-prepared for this change, can we face the challenge in the future and be the winner of the next stage. 

三、范文点评

文章结构：

从结构上看，范文按照提纲要求分为三段：第一段写得比较简洁，对图画进行了描写；第二段在段首给出主题句，也就是漫画作者的意图，进而层层深入，进行论证，从赛跑的起点和终点推到人生的起点和终点上，反映出深刻的人生哲理；第三段按照提纲要求举出一些例子，段首为该段主题句，中间给出三个例子，层次非常清晰，而且，最后一个例子联系考生实际情况，很有感召力。

语言亮点：

\1. dash：“猛冲，急驰，飞奔”，这个词很形象，短距离赛跑专用该词，它也可以充当名词，即：make a dash for the finishing line，此外，能够表达这种快速移动的含义，替换dash的词还有：rush, hurry, dart, scamper等。

\2. congratulating himself on finishing：congratulate oneself on…“独自庆幸”。例如There are so many fishing boats that the only fish left must be congratulating itself on its narrow escape.（渔船如此之多，仅剩的一条鱼肯定在为自己幸免于难而暗自庆幸）。

\3. define：“确定”，此处还可以用infer, detect，conclude等词。

\4. reveal：“揭示”，类似含义的词还有show, expose, illustrate, demonstrate等

\5. represent：“代表，代替”,可替代的词有stand for, symbolize, manifest, portray, characterize, describe等 

\6. no more than 与接下来的merely的意思接近，都是“仅仅、只有”，此处的写作技巧为使用近义词,避免重复。可替换的表达还有：only, just, simply等。

\7. while：这个转折连词适合引导对比的句子，而且对仗工整。例如Love is not treasured buy one surrounded by love, while to an orphan it is what he desires most in the world. （一个被爱包围的人不会看重爱，然而，对于一个孤儿来说，爱是这个世界上他最渴望得到的东西）。

\8. short-term：“短期的”。反义词为long-term，也可以用in the shot run和in the long run，但后两个表达在句子中做状语。

\9. rather … than…：“是…而不是…”。这个结构可以并列任何并列词性，但需要保持一致。例如：It is rather the parents than the child who make decisions for the latter.（为孩子作决定的是父母而不是孩子自己）。

\10. mark：“标志着”，它与announce（宣布）形成对仗。可替换的词有：indicate, signal, declare, proclaim等

\11. persuasive：“富有说服力的”，替换词有convincing

\12. long-awaited：“盼望已久的”，它与well-prepared（准备很好的）构词相同，均为“副词+动词过去分词”做复合形容词。考生在写作中要掌握它们的使用。类似形容词有：above-mentioned上面提到的， long-established长久存在的，much-needed非常需要的，much-praised倍受赞扬的， not-yet-ended尚未结束的，often-repeated常被重复的，well-known著名的，wide-spread广泛流传的。 

\13. trigger off：“启动，激发, 引起”，trigger原指“扣扳机”，使用其引伸义,非常形象。

\14. start a brand new chapter：“开始崭新的一章”，相同的表达为turn a new page。

\15. occur to sb.：“某人突然想起…”

\16. era：“时代”，近义词为age或time。这个词多指具有标志性事物或人物的时期，用在文中非常恰当，如：the Kennedy era（肯尼迪时代），the era of space travel（太空旅行时代）。

\17. further：该词是个常见词，含义简单但使用灵活。它作形容词可以表示“进一步的”，如further development（进一步发展）。还可以用作动词，表示“继续”，例如：With the furthering of cultural exchanges, more and more people will accept notions and customs which used to be totally foreign to them.（随着文化交流进一步深入，越来越多的人会接受一些以前对他们来说非常陌生的观念和习俗）。

四、写作误区

篇章结构误区：

写作中容易犯的第一个错误是跑题，有的考生把这篇文章写成了记叙文，花了大篇幅描述图画上的赛跑者，写他经过努力终于跑到了终点。也有考生好不容易憋出了一个主题，如：成功在于过程，不在结果。还有考生甚至想出的主题是：人很容易陷入一个又一个的怪圈，所以当你发现自己无法控制你的生活时，就要跳出这个怪圈。有考生这样写道“In the evening we finish all the things and go to bed, which means today’s over, but when we open our eyes, we will face a new day and a new challenge. That’s a order of nature, which we cannot avoid.”这段话根本没有涉及到该图画的内涵，而是谈了一些肤浅的生活琐事。这些都是审题不够准确，产生偏差造成的。

其次，需要避免的误区是例证不充分或不典型。有些考生在举例说明自己的观点时，只停留在论述自己个人生活层面上。还有些考生只是反复地谈论从小学到大学再到社会参加工作的各个阶段。

语言表达错误： 

①用词错误：

A boy is throughing a line which is either a starting point or a terminal point.（A boy is crossing a line which is both a starting point and a terminal line.）  

②时态混乱：

For example, the student is working hard in the classes and wishes to have a good mark.（For example, the student works hard in the class and wishes to have a good mark.）

③非谓语结构错误：

His fault is satisfied with the past success and paid little attention to the present challenge.（His fault is being satisfied with the past success and paying little attention to the present challenge.）

④句子连接混乱：

The reason why you have no need to look back is whether you win or lose, it has been past, they can do nothing on the problem you are facing.（The reason why you need not look back is, whether you win or lose, it is past and can do nothing to the problem you are facing.）

⑤说话角度混乱：

In our lives, we have several steps to experience. Although you have got to the finishing point of one step, it doesn’t mean you have accomplished the whole race.（In our lives, we have several stages to experience. Although we have got to the finishing point of one stage, it doesn’t mean we have accomplished the whole race.）

⑥中式英语：

But it doesn’t matter, if you again start from the beginning and do your best, you try again and again. Sooner or later, you will success.（But it doesn’t matter. If you start again from the beginning and do your best, sooner or later, you will succeed.）

#### Text 1

Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster who built the Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated with information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the “great game” of espionage -- spying as a “profession.” These days the Net, which has already re-made such everyday pastimes as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan’s vocation as well.

The latest revolution isn’t simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen’s e-mail. That kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the past three or four years, the World Wide Web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying. The spooks call it “open-source intelligence,” and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly influential. In 1995 the CIA held a contest to see who could compile the most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large margin, was a tiny Virginia company called Open Source Solutions, whose clear advantage was its mastery of the electronic world.

Among the firms making the biggest splash in this new world is Straitford, Inc., a private intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the results of spying (covering nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like energy-services firm McDermott International. Many of its predictions are available online at *www.straitford.com*.

Straitford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of mutually reinforcing tool for both information collection and distribution, a spymaster’s dream. Last week his firm was busy vacuuming up data bits from the far corners of the world and predicting a crisis in Ukraine. “As soon as that report runs, we’ll suddenly get 500 new Internet sign-ups from Ukraine,” says Friedman, a former political science professor. “And we’ll hear back from some of them.” Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since it can be difficult to tell good information from bad. That’s where Straitford earns its keep.

Friedman relies on a lean staff of 20  in Austin. Several of his staff members have military-intelligence backgrounds. He sees the firm’s outsider status as the key to its success. Straitford’s briefs don’t sound like the usual Washington back-and-forthing, whereby agencies avoid dramatic declarations on the chance they might be wrong. Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its independent voice.

\41.   The emergence of the Net has ________.

[A] received support from fans like Donovan

[B] remolded the intelligence services

[C] restored many common pastimes（B）

[D] revived spying as a profession

\42.   Donovan’s story is mentioned in the text to ________.

[A] introduce the topic of online spying

[B] show how he fought for the U.S.

[C] give an episode of the information war（A）

[D] honor his unique services to the CIA

\43.   The phrase “making the biggest splash” (Line 1, Paragraph 3) most probably means ________.

[A] causing the biggest trouble

[B] exerting the greatest effort

[C] achieving the greatest success（C）

[D] enjoying the widest popularity

\44.   It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that ________.

[A] Straitford’s prediction about Ukraine has proved true

[B] Straitford guarantees the truthfulness of its information

[C] Straitford’s business is characterized by unpredictability（D）

[D] Straitford is able to provide fairly reliable information

\45.   Straitford is most proud of its ________.

[A] official status

[B] nonconformist image

[C] efficient staff（B）

[D] military background

To paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, “all that is needed for the triumph of a misguided cause is that good people do nothing.” One such cause now seeks to end biomedical research because of the theory that animals have rights ruling out their use in research. Scientists need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public and thereby threatening advances in health knowledge and care. Leaders of the animal rights movement target biomedical research because it depends on public funding, and few people understand the process of health care research. Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in research settings, many are perplexed that anyone would deliberately harm an animal.

For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that comes from or is tested in animals—no meat, no fur, no medicines. Asked if she opposed immunizations, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured that they do, she replied, “Then I would have to say yes.” Asked what will happen when epidemics return, she said, “Don’t worry, scientists will find some way of using computers.” Such well-meaning people just don’t understand.

Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate, understandable way -- in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between animal research and a grandmother’s hip replacement, a father’s bypass operation, a baby’s vaccinations, and even a pet’s shots. To those who are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.

Much can be done. Scientists could “adopt” middle school classes and present their own research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, lest animal rights misinformation go unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research institutions could be opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive medical treatment. If good people do nothing, there is a real possibility that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the precious embers of medical progress.

\46.   The author begins his article with Edmund Burke’s words to ________.

[A] call on scientists to take some actions

[B] criticize the misguided cause of animal rights

[C] warn of the doom of biomedical research（A）

[D] show the triumph of the animal rights movement

\47.   Misled people tend to think that using an animal in research is ________.

[A] cruel but natural

[B] inhuman and unacceptable

[C] inevitable but vicious（B）

[D] pointless and wasteful

\48.   The example of the grandmotherly woman is used to show the public’s ________.

[A] discontent with animal research

[B] ignorance about medical science

[C] indifference to epidemics（B）

[D] anxiety about animal rights

 

\49.   The author believes that, in face of the challenge from animal rights advocates, scientists should ________.

[A] communicate more with the public

[B] employ hi-tech means in research

[C] feel no shame for their cause（A）

[D] strive to develop new cures

\50.   From the text we learn that Stephen Cooper is ________.

[A] a well-known humanist

[B] a medical practitioner

[C] an enthusiast in animal rights（D）

[D] a supporter of animal research

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems, causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads accounted for under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series of mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the freight moved by major rail carriers.

Supporters of the new supersystems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial cost reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by fierce competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads therefore have them by the throat.

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only one rail company. Railroads typically charge such “captive” shippers 20 to 30 percent more than they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they are being overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government’s Surface Transportation Board for rate relief, but the process is expensive, time-consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.

Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the long run it reduces everyone’s cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue, shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so, leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line. It’s a theory to which many economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which companies will flourish and which will fail. “Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who wins and who loses in the marketplace?” asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents shippers.

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be hit with a round of huge rate increases. The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortunes, still does not earn enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street cheering them on. Consider the $10.2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail’s net railway operating income in 1996 was just $427 million, less than half of the carrying costs of the transaction. Who’s going to pay for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will, as Norfolk Southern and CSX increase their grip on the market.

\51.   According to those who support mergers, railway monopoly is unlikely because ________.

[A] cost reduction is based on competition

[B] services call for cross-trade coordination

[C] outside competitors will continue to exist（C）

[D] shippers will have the railway by the throat

\52.   What is many captive shippers’ attitude towards the consolidation in the rail industry?

[A] Indifferent.

[B] Supportive.

[C] Indignant.（D）

[D] Apprehensive.

\53.   It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.

[A] shippers will be charged less without a rival railroad

[B] there will soon be only one railroad company nationwide

[C] overcharged shippers are unlikely to appeal for rate relief（C）

[D] a government board ensures fair play in railway business

\54.   The word “arbiters” (Line 7, Paragraph 4) most probably refers to those ________.

[A] who work as coordinators

[B] who function as judges

[C] who supervise transactions（B）

[D] who determine the price

\55.   According to the text, the cost increase in the rail industry is mainly caused by ________.

[A] the continuing acquisition

[B] the growing traffic

[C] the cheering Wall Street（A）

[D] the shrinking market

#### Text 4

It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional. Small wonder. Americans’ life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century. Failing hips can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minute surgical procedure. Such advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was unimaginable when I entered medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure death -- and our failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.

Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved. Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless. The most obvious example is late-stage cancer care. Physicians -- frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient -- too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

In 1950, the U.S. spent $12.7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age -- say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way,” so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential.

I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond, and remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to be 53. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor is in her 70s, and former surgeon general C. Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s. These leaders are living proof that prevention works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-year-old, I wish to age as productively as they have.

Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. As a physician, I know the most costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that people in Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people’s lives.

\56.   What is implied in the first sentence?

[A] Americans are better prepared for death than other people.

[B] Americans enjoy a higher life quality than ever before.

[C] Americans are over-confident of their medical technology.（C）

[D] Americans take a vain pride in their long life expectancy.

\57.   The author uses the example of cancer patients to show that ________.

[A] medical resources are often wasted

[B] doctors are helpless against fatal diseases

[C] some treatments are too aggressive（A）

[D] medical costs are becoming unaffordable

\58.   The author’s attitude toward Richard Lamm’s remark is one of ________.

[A] strong disapproval

[B] reserved consent

[C] slight contempt（B）

[D] enthusiastic support

\59.   In contrast to the U.S., Japan and Sweden are funding their medical care ________.

[A] more flexibly

[B] more extravagantly

[C] more cautiously（D）

[D] more reasonably

\60.   The text intends to express the idea that ________.

[A] medicine will further prolong people’s lives

[B] life beyond a certain limit is not worth living

[C] death should be accepted as a fact of life（C）

[D] excessive demands increase the cost of health care

**Directions:**

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (10 points)

Human beings in all times and places think about their world and wonder at their place in it. Humans are thoughtful and creative, possessed of insatiable curiosity. 61) Furthermore, humans have the ability to modify the environment in which they live, thus subjecting all other life forms to their own peculiar ideas and fancies. Therefore, it is important to study humans in all their richness and diversity in a calm and systematic manner, with the hope that the knowledge resulting from such studies can lead humans to a more harmonious way of living with themselves and with all other life forms on this planet Earth.

“Anthropology” derives from the Greek words *anthropos:* “human” and *logos* “the study of.” By its very name, anthropology encompasses the study of all humankind.

Anthropology is one of the social sciences. 62) Social science is that branch of intellectual enquiry which seeks to study humans and their endeavors in the same reasoned, orderly, systematic, and dispassioned manner that natural scientists use for the study of natural phenomena.

Social science disciplines include geography, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. Each of these social sciences has a subfield or specialization which lies particularly close to anthropology.

All the social sciences focus upon the study of humanity. Anthropology is a field-study oriented discipline which makes extensive use of the comparative method in analysis. 63) The emphasis on data gathered first-hand, combined with a cross-cultural perspective brought to the analysis of cultures past and present, makes this study a unique and distinctly important social science.

Anthropological analyses rest heavily upon the concept of culture. Sir Edward Tylor’s formulation of the concept of culture was one of the great intellectual achievements of 19th century science. 64) Tylor defined culture as “… that complex whole which includes belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.” This insight, so profound in its simplicity, opened up an entirely new way of perceiving and understanding human life. Implicit within Tylor’s definition is the concept that culture is learned, shared, and patterned behavior.

65) Thus, the anthropological concept of “culture,” like the concept of “set” in mathematics, is an abstract concept which makes possible immense amounts of concrete research and understanding.

**Section II: Use of English (10 points)**

**一、文章总体分析**

文章主要论述了教师们应该关注青少年在成长时期所经历的情感、心智和生理上的变化，并采取方法帮助他们适应这些变化，健康成长。

第一段第一、二句是主题句，点明文章主题。从第三句开始介绍了青少年的各种变化，如：自我意识很强，需要从成功中获得自信等。接下来是对老师的建议：设计有更多优胜者的活动，组织各种小型俱乐部，让成年人在幕后支持。

第二段特别强调教师在设计活动时要注意保持其多样性，以适应青少年注意力持续时间短的特点。此外，成年人要帮助学生在活动中培养责任感。

**二、试题具体解析**

21 **[****答案]** **A** 

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**平行句子结构** + **固定搭配**。

首先，从文章结构上看，第一段的第一、二句是平行的并列句：Teachers need to be aware of（教师应该注意）和And they also need to give serious  1  to（同时他们须认真……）。注意第二句中的两个they分别指代了第一句中的teachers和young adults，第二句中的give serious  1  to与第一句中的be aware of（知道，意识到）也应在意义上相呼应。

其次，考生需要判断四个选项中哪一个能与 give...to 构成短语。idea这个词词义很丰富，包括“想法、意思、概念、思想、意识、打算、建议”等，但通常与介词of而不是to连用；opinion意为“意见；看法”，一般不与give搭配；advice（建议）虽然可与give及to搭配，但介词to后应接人，即建议的接受者，如果要表达“提出…方面的建议”，应该用“give advice on sth.”。只有give thought to是一个固定搭配，其中的thought 不能替换为别的词汇，它放入句中表示“同时他们也应当对这些年轻人如何最好地   2   这些变化加以思考”。

例句补充：I gave much thought to what he said yesterday.（我对他昨天说的那番话做了许多思考）**；T**he book gives you a good idea of life in ancient Greece. (这本书能让你对古希腊的生活有一些了解)；Everyone has a poor opinion of a coward.（每个人对懦夫的印象都不好）；Now I want to give you some advice. (现在我想给你提些建议)。

22．**[答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**动宾搭配**。

本题要求考生判断哪个动词可以与such changes构成动宾搭配。such changes在这里指的是第一句提到的the emotional, intellectual, and physical changes。从结构上看，空格所在部分是由how连接一个句子做give thought to的介词宾语。句子中they指代的是young adults（年轻人）。从语意上看，考生关键要判断“年轻人”对他们“情感、心智和生理上的变化”做什么动作，四个选项中accommodate表达的含义最恰当，即“适应变化”。整个句子的含义是“教师也需要认真考虑年轻人如何最好地适应这些（情感、心智和生理上的）变化”。常与change搭配的动词请参见2004年第13题。

知识点补充：accommodate表示“适应”时，还常用accommodate oneself to sth.结构，*例句*：He has to accommodate himself to changed situation.（他不得不适应变化了的形势）。

23．**[答案]** **C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语意 + 名词词义辨析**。

文中相关部分是“成长的身体需要运动和__3__，但不仅仅是在强调竞赛的方面需要这些”。因此考生需要判断空格处应填入什么名词，与movement并列做need的宾语。首先，考生判断四个选项中哪一个是身体成长时所需要的（除运动以外的）另一样东西。从某种意义上说，选项中所提到的四种东西都是需要的，但是下文对这里所需要的东西进行了限定，即，和movement同样都可以通过竞赛的方式来实现。这样只有exercise合适，它与competition 属于同一语义范畴，并可以用于竞赛。

24.**[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**逻辑关系**。

空格所在长句中包含了两个由逗号隔开的分句：__4__ they are adjusting to…，teenagers are especially self-conscious。两个分句有共同的主语，前一句中的they就指代下一句中的teenagers。考生需要判断这两个分句之间是什么逻辑关系。从语意上看，前一分句意为“青少年正在适应新的身体状况、心智和情感方面的诸多挑战”，下一分句意为“他们的自我意识很强”，显然这之间不是条件或转折关系，而是一个因果关系，即“由于适应变化，所以自我意识强烈”。因此because最为恰当。

知识点补充：a host of表示“一大群，好些”，常接可数名词，*例句*：I have a host of things to do today. ( 我今天有一大堆事情要做)。

25.**[****答案] C**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义+名词词义辨析**。

​    文中相关部分是：（teenagers）need the   5   that comes from achieving success（青少年需要由获得成功而得到的……），其中that引导的定语从句修饰空格处的名词。因此考生只需要判断四个选项中哪一样东西可以从成功中得到。一般来讲，获得成功后，我们常常得到的是confidence（信心）。

26.**[****答案]** **B**

​    **[****解析**] 本题考核的知识点是：**常识**+**动词词义辨析**。

本题的考点与上题有重合的地方。文中相关部分是：（teenagers）need the confidence that comes from achieving success and knowing that their accomplishments are   6  by others （青少年需要自信，自信来自成功，也来自知道他们的成绩受到别人的……）。首先，考生要注意分析其中定语从句的结构：句中主语是that指代的先行词confidence，谓语是comes from，宾语是两个动名词结构achieving success和knowing that…。因此考生关键要判断青少年的自信来自于知道他们的成绩（accomplishments）受到别人的什么。根据常识，只有当自己的成绩受到别人羡慕时，人们才会产生信心。显然只有admired符合文意。

知识点补充：accomplishment的构词法是：accomplish（完成）+-ment（名词后缀表行为），类似的词还有achievement，development，establishment，fulfillment等。

27.**[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义+形容词词义辨析**。

空格所在句子的句型结构是**so** much competition that…，句意为“青少年典型的生活中已经充满了这么多的竞争，以至于策划胜者多败者少的活动将是__7__的”。考生需要判断在充满竞争的青少年生活中，设计一些不那么具有竞争性的活动是怎样的。由于上文一再强调，青少年需要成功和信心，因此这里应该填入一个表示肯定态度的词，来肯定这种胜者多败者少的活动，这样就可以首先排除improper和risky。在剩下的fair和 wise中，后者更符合句意，因为这里的问题不是公平与否，而是是否明智。让更多青少年在活动中通过取胜来获得信心是明智的做法，是适合他们成长需要的。

28.**[****答案]** **C** 

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**逻辑关系**。

​    空格前文是to plan activities in which there are more winners than losers（策划一些胜者多败者少的活动），后文是publishing newsletters with many student written book reviews（出版刊有许多学生撰写书评的通讯）。本题要求考生判断两部分之间是什么逻辑关系。从语意上看，前文是泛指一些活动（activities），后文是具体的活动（publishing newsletters），因此两者之间是综述和例证的逻辑关系，“发表学生写的书评”是“胜者多败者少的活动”的例子。能够表达例证逻辑关系的只有for example。

29.**[****答案]** **A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义+动宾搭配**。

从句子结构上看，__9___student artwork和前面的publishing newsletters以及后面的sponsoring book discussion clubs在结构上并列，都是教师策划的胜者多败者少活动的例子。因此考生需要判断选项中哪个动名词中的核心动词能与student artwork（学生的艺术品）构成动宾搭配，并体现出胜者多败者少的特点。四个选项中，只有“展示（displaying）”符合句意。

30.**[****答案]** **D**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**句内语义 +** **形容词词义辨析**。

文中的相关部分是A variety of small clubs can provide   10__ opportunities，它要求考生判断各种各样的小型俱乐部可以提供什么样的机会。解题的关键词是前面的variety（多样，多样性），多种多样的俱乐部应该提供多种多样的（multiple）机会，而不是持久的（durable），过多的（excessive）或多余的（surplus）机会。

词汇补充：四个选项中，durable原义是“能够抵抗磨损，撕扯或腐蚀的”，引伸义是“持久的”，如：a durable friendship（持久的友谊）；excessive指“过多的，过量的”，多为贬义，如：excessive drinking（酗酒）；surplus指“比需要的或必需的更多”，如：surplus population（过剩人口）；multiple 指“复合的，由多个部分组成的，多样的”，如：a man of multiple interests (兴趣广泛的人)。

31.**[****答案]** **A**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义 + 名词词义辨析**。

​    文中的相关部分是clubs can provide opportunities for leadership, as well as for practice in successful  11 _dynamics，注意其中的连词as well as（而且）表明for practice和for leadership并列修饰opportunities，即“俱乐部不仅提供（学生）培养领导才能的机会，也提供成功地参与…的练习机会。”dynamics意为“动力学”，“动态关系”，这里表达一种动态的人际互动关系。考生需要判断学生在俱乐部里可以进行哪方面的动态关系的练习。注意上下文中的club和leadership显示了这是一种团队活动，选项中的 individual概念与之相矛盾，personnel和corporation不适合文章谈论的对象。对于学校学生来说，在“团体动态关系即集体活动”方面提供练习的说法比较合理，因此，group为正确答案。

32.**[****答案]** **D**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义 + 名词词义辨析**。

​     文中相关部分说，“交朋友对青少年极端重要，许多腼腆的学生都需要某种团体所提供的 _12 _”。考生要判断“团体”能够为腼腆的学生提供什么。最恰当的选项是security，因为腼腆的学生需要交朋友，需要加入某种团体以获得安全感。最具干扰的选项是admission，它可以表示“获得加入某个团体或机构的权利”，但它必须与to或into搭配，*例句*：China’s admission to the United Nations（允许中国加入联合国）。

33.**[****答案]** **B**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义 + 副词用法辨析**。

文章相关部分是shy students need the security with a supportive adult   13   visible in the background，空格处将填入一个副词修饰visible，其含义是“腼腆的学生需要一定的安全感，这种安全感来自一位成人在背后……能看见的地方提供支持”。根据文意可推知，青少年需要成人的支持，但不需要成人过多的参与，因为他们需要独立地去完成事情。选项中particularly和definitely是程度副词，在visible前可表强调，但“特别看得见”和“肯定看得见”不合文意；rarely为频率副词，加进去表示“有时看得见，有时看不见”，因此也不合适。成人既在场，又不显眼，barely visible（几乎看不见）最符合文意。

知识点补充：barely表示否定概念，如：I could barely see the road in the fog. (我在雾中几乎不能看清路)。该词含义与hardly和scarcely相近。

34.**[****答案]** **D**     

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**常识的运用**。

空格后的attention span指“注意力的持续时间”。本题要求考生判断青少年的注意力持续时间是长还是短。按常理青少年一般比较好动，往往不能持续地关注某一件事。据说，小学生注意力的持续时间大约为半小时，超过半小时后，他们就不能够集中精力。随着年龄的增长，人的注意力持续时间会增长，成人一般能够持续工作3～4小时。在此题中，应该选择short，即“青少年的注意力持续时间较短”。此外，下文提到“应当组织各种各样的活动，以便让参加者保持活跃”，从而可知这也是为了适应青少年注意力持续时间短的特点。

35.**[****答案]** **C**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**逻辑关系**。

空格前文是A variety of activities should be organized（组织各种各样的活动），后文是participants can remain active（让参加者保持活跃）。本题要求考生判断这两部分之间是什么逻辑关系。从逻辑上讲，让活动多样化应该是为了让参与者保持兴趣，两者之间是手段与目的的关系，这里需要一个表目的的连词，因此只有so that符合文意。

知识点补充：if only常用于虚拟语气，如：If only Mother were here.（要是妈妈在这就好了）；now that表条件，常置于句首，如：Now that everyone is here，let’s start the meeting.（既然所有人都到了，我们开会吧）；even if 表让步，如：Even if he came，the result would be the same.（即使他来了，结果还是会一样）。

36.**[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**不定代词用法辨析**。

本题要求考生判断哪个选项可与else搭配并适合句意。在不同情况下，四个选项都可与else搭配。但是，根据语法的要求，anything用于疑问句和否定句中，所以在此不适合。空格所在句子的含义是“应当组织各种各样的活动，以便让参加者保持活跃，然后转而参与其他……活动，而不会感到内疚”，显然，everything 和nothing与else搭配后表达的“其他所有活动”和“没有其他任何活动”不符合文意，只有something else表示的“（继续参与）其他某种活动”符合句子语法和前后语意关系的搭配，为正确选项。

知识点补充：else可与something这类代词连用。如：Let’s try something else.（我们尝试一下其它的事吧）；I don’t think there is anything else we need discuss tonight. (我不认为今天晚上还有其他什么事情要讨论)；He had nothing else to do except to return to his room.（除了回房间，他没有其他事情可做/别无选择）；Everything else depends upon that.（其他的每件事都取决于此）。

37.**[****答案]** **B**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**短语动词用法辨析**。

文中相关部分说，“（教师）应该组织各种各样的活动，以便让参加者保持活跃，然后转而参与别的活动，既不会感到内疚，也不会让其他参加者_ 17 _”。显然这里需要一个和feeling guilty并列的贬义词组。即考生需判断“不断参加其他活动”除了可能让参与者自己内疚外，还会让其他人怎么样。选项中的副词都可以与 let 搭配，但只有let others down（让其他人失望）符合这个要求。

知识点补充：这个题目反映出对短语动词的辨析是英语知识运用的一个重要考点。短语动词指的是由动词加介词、副词或其他词构成的固定词组。最常见的几类短语动词包括：动+介，动+副，动+名+介，动+副+介。其中有部分动词形成的短语动词特别丰富，考生需要专门对他们进行总结和区分，这些动词包括：bring，call，cast，catch，come，cut，get，give，go，keep，leave，let，look，make，put，set，take，turn，throw等等。

38.**[****答案]** **A**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**逻辑关系 + 短语用法辨析**。

空格前后是两个完整的句子，因此填入的短语应反映出它们之间的逻辑关系。前面部分是“这并不是说成人没有责任”，后面部分是“他们还可以帮助学生获得一种责任感”，两者的意思是完全对立的，即后一部分与前一部分相反。选项中只有 On the contrary能够准确表达这种含义。注意On the other hand强调的是事物存在两面性，并存两种可能性。如：He is clever, but on the other hand, he makes many mistakes.（他很聪明，但从另一方面来说，他也犯了不少错）。

例句补充：“Have you nearly done?” “On the contrary, I have only just begun.”（—你差不多做完了吧？—恰恰相反，我刚刚开始）；Women make on the average only two-thirds of what men earn.（平均算来，女性的收入仅是男性收入的三分之二）；You have made a few mistakes but on the whole you have done well.（你犯了几个错误，但总体来说，你做的很好）。

39.**[****答案]** **C**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**短语动词辨析**。

文中相关部分是they can help students acquire a sense of commitment by  19  for roles （成人能够帮助学生获得一种责任感，通过（为他们）……一些角色），其中介词by表明_19__for roles是help students acquire a sense of commitment的方式和手段。commitment意为“承担的责任和义务，承诺”。由于四个选项都可以与for搭配构成短语动词，考生关键需要判断哪个短语动词可与roles搭配，并符合文意。planning for填入空格后表示“策划创造一些（合适的）角色”，可以看作是“帮助学生获得责任感”的手段，而且它还与前面提到的plan activities，a variety of activities should be organized相呼应。

知识点补充：与介词for构成短语动词的还包括：account for（解释），allow for（考虑到），answer for（对……负责），apply for（申请），arrange for（安排），ask for（问候），crave for（渴望），fall for（深信，倾心于），go in for（爱好），hope for（希望），hanker for（渴望），hunt for（寻找），have a taste for（喜好），long for（渴望），pray for（祈求），speak for（为……辩护），search for（要求，寻找），thirst for（渴望），want for（缺少），wish for（希望），yearn for（思慕）。

40.**[****答案]** **A**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**名词词义辨析**。

空格所在句子是help students acquire a sense of commitment by planning for roles that are within their_ 20__ and their attention spans，其中that引导的定语从句修饰先行词roles，表示“通过涉及一些在学生……范围之内和其注意力持续时间之内的角色，帮助学生获得一种责任感”。因此考生需要判断这些角色在青少年的什么范围之内。四个选项中首先排除proficiency和efficiency，它们不能和within搭配，且句意不符。选项responsibility有很大干扰性，因为它是“commitment”的近义词，但考生需仔细考虑一下，此处“responsibility”修饰的是“roles”，“角色”是需要付诸实践的行动，和“responsibility”不能搭配，不可以说“在责任范围内的角色”。只有capabilities符合句意的要求，填入空格后意为“一些学生能力范围和在其注意力持续时间之内的角色”，既表示学生有能力完成，也承接上文，说明学生的注意力还可以集中。

知识点补充：-ency/-ence和-ility/-ity是常见的形容词变为名词的后缀，都表示“性质、状态、情况”，如：proficiency=proficient精通+cy，efficiency=efficient有效率的+cy，innocence=innocent天真的+ce，urgency=urgent紧急的+cy，emergency=emergent紧急的+cy；capability=capable能干的+ility，responsibility=responsible有责任的+ility，juvenility=juvenile青少年的+ity，servility=servile奴性的+ity，fragility=fragile易碎的+ity。

**三、全文翻译**

教师应当意识到青少年在成长时期所经历的情感、心智和生理上的变化。同时他们还应当对这些年轻人如何适应这些变化加以思考。青少年成长中,身体需要运动和锻炼，但这并不是仅仅通过竞争的方式来进行。因为青少年正在适应新的身体状况、心智和情感方面的诸多挑战，所以他们的自我意识很强。他们需要有成功后的自信，并且需要自己的成就受到别人的钦佩。然而，典型的青少年生活中已经充满了竞争，因此策划一些胜者多败者少的活动是十分明智的。例如，出版有许多学生撰写书评的通讯，展示学生的艺术作品，组织读书研讨俱乐部等。各种小型俱乐部可提供多种多样的机会来培养青少年的领导才能，也能提供青少年成功参与集体活动的练习。交友对青少年极为重要，许多腼腆的学生需要某种团体所提供的安全感。在这个团体里，成人提供的支持处于几乎看不见的隐蔽地位。

​    在这些活动中，需要记住的是青少年的注意力持续时间非常短，所以应当组织各种各样的活动，以便让参加者保持活跃，然后转而参与别的活动，而不会感到内疚，也不会让其他参与者失望。这并不是说成人没有责任。相反，成人可以通过策划一些学生能力范围和在其注意力持续时间之内的角色来培养他们的责任感。

Section III: Reading Comprehension (50 points)

Part A (40 points)

**Text 1**


 

**41.[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

关于A选项，文章第一句指出，若Wild Bill Donovan还在世的话，他会爱上互联网的，即一定会利用它来进行情报工作。句子使用的是虚拟语气（would have loved），这说明多诺汶在世时并没有互联网。而且我们从文章的后面的几句话也能证实这一论断，因此，多诺汶是互联网的爱好者的说法是错误的。关于B选项，文章第一段结尾指出：“These days the Net, which has already re-made pastimes as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan’s vocation as well.”。其中的“Donovan’s vocation”指的就是“intelligence services”（情报工作）。此外，解答本题的另一个关键是对“reshape”一词的理解，它的含义是“recast，remold”即“改造，给···以新形式”，因此B选项为正确答案。

选择D选项的考生在于对“reshape”和“revive”的词义差别区分不清。这里的“revive”是主要意义是“to come or bring back into use or existence”(<使>恢复，<使>复兴，<使>复归使用)，暗含的意思是某事物已经不存在或已经丧失作用。在第一段中并没有谈到间谍行业曾经消失的信息。在第二段中，我们知道互联网的出现推动了情报行业的发展，也没有找到任何有关情报行业曾经中断的信息。而选项C所对应的原文是“re-made pastimes as buying books and sending mail”，意思是：互联网改变了人们的日常生活方式，如买书，发邮件等。考生要注意区别“restore”和“re-make”的含义。原文中的“re-make”的含义是“re-create”（改变，重新创造）。即重新创造一种消遣方式：人们现在足不出户，通过网络就可以实现购书或发电子邮件。这当然不是恢复平常的消遣活动。

知识点补充：re-是个常见的前缀，表示“再，重新”，该题中涉及到的词汇都和这个前缀有关。restore的含义主要有：①bring back into existence or use；reestablish（使恢复存在或使用；重新建立）；②bring back to an original condition（使回到原来的状态）；③put (someone) back in a former position（使复职，把（某人）放回原来地位）。


 

**42.[****答案]** **A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者意图题**。

题干要求考生识别作者的写作意图。回答本题时，考生需要从整段或全文的角度去考虑。作者在写文章时举出某一个具体的例子来表达他所要表达的观点。在解答文章的主旨题时要注意充分利用文章中提到的细节，读懂了这些细节，弄清了文章的篇章结构有助于把握文章的主旨，反过来，了解文章的大致主题和观点也可以帮助我们吃透细节。

本文只在第一段提到比尔·多诺汶，其余部分讨论的都是情报工作在互联网时代的巨大变化，以及它面临的机会和挑战。文章列举司特雷福公司的例子去说明互联网为谍报工作提供了巨大的可能性，因此文章的中心议题是情报工作和互联网的关系。多诺汶作为一个大间谍只是为文章展开讨论前提供了一个引子，因此A选项为正确答案。其他B、C、D选项虽然可能都与多诺汶的生平事迹有关，但是与文章主题无关，因此都不正确。


 

**43.[****答案]** **C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**词义题**。

题干要求考生根据上下文猜测短语。文章第二段谈到，在互联网时代对“公开来源情报”的收集具有越来越重要的影响，中央情报局也对它十分重视。然后第三段又列举了“司特雷福公司”这个典型的例子，说它是在这个领域的佼佼者。making the biggest splash的含义是“to create a forceful, favorable, and noticeable effect”，即创造一种强有力的、良好的和引人注意的效果，也就是取得了最大的成功，而不是“引起最大的麻烦”。

此外，如果司特雷福公司“做出最大努力”而未取得成功，它也不会成为一个典型例子，因此B选项也是错误的。D选项在文中根本没有提及。


 




 

**44.[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

第四段的主要内容是：Friedman将互联网作为一个双向的工具，既用来收集信息，又用来发布信息。然后以Ukraine的例子说明网络互动的实际作用。该段的最后两句指出：公开来源的谍报活动有它的风险，因为情报的真伪难辨。司特雷福公司就是靠辨别情报的真伪吃饭的。这就暗示司特雷福公司能够提供相当可靠的情报，因此，D选项为正确选项。

B选项的说法太绝对，因为司特雷福公司既然担有风险，它就不能够保证信息100%可靠。从常理上来说，这也是不可能的。A选项的说法没有根据，因为司特雷福公司只是对乌克兰的局势作出了预测，但没有提到预测已经被证实是真的。文章只提到一旦信息被公布，会收到一些人的反馈。C选项的说法在文中也找不到根据，因为文中只提到司特雷福公司提供的信息具有不可预测的特点，并不是说它的业务也有不可预测的特征。

知识点补充：reliable（可靠的、可信赖的）的近义词有：dependable，responsible， trustworthy，trusty。这些词的中心含义都是“worthy of reliance or trust”（值得依赖和信任）。


 




 

**45.[****答案] B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

文章最后一句直接指出，司特雷福公司对其“independent voice（独立的声音）”感到自豪。与其他公司不同，司特雷福公司避免外界的左右。公司不同于政府，它具有“outsider（局外人）”的地位，不对官方的腔调随声附和，可以独立地宣称自己的主张，因此它给人的印象是“不随大流的形象”，这也就是它引以为豪的地方。虽然公司某些员工来自军事情报机构，但是公司本身并不附属于军方，因此D选项不正确；C选项在文中也找不到依据。

知识点补充：nonconformist中前缀non-表示“非，不”，conformist原来的含义是指“宗教上遵奉国教”，引伸义是“墨守陈规者”，noncomformist的含义包括“非国教徒，不墨守成规的（人）”。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析:

①The American spymaster *who* built the Office of Strategic Services in the World War Ⅱ *and* later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated with information.

这个句子的特点是定语从句中含有两个并列的分句。该句子的主干是：The American spymaster...was fascinated with information，主语后是 who 引导的定语从句，对其修饰限制。定语从句中由and连接的两个分句是：built the Office …和laid the roots …。搭配be fascinated with意为“对…着迷”，lay the roots for意为“为…打下基础”。

②Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the “great game” of espionage—spying as a “profession”.

句子主干是Donovan believed in using...，其中using的宾语是关系代词whatever引导的宾语从句：whatever tools came to hand。in the “great game” of espionage做状语成分，破折号后的内容spying as a “profession”是对espionage的进一步解释说明。固定短语come to hand意为“到手”。

补充：whatever和它一类的疑问代词（whichever，whoever，whomever）除了有一般代词的用法外，还可以做关系代词，相当于any thing(s) that，any one(s) that，any person(s) who。如：He did whatever he could do.（他做了他能做的任何事）。

③The winner, by a large margin, was a tiny Virginia company called Open-Source Solutions, whose clear advantage was its mastery of the electronic world.

该句的特点是多重定语。句子主干是The winner... was a tiny Virginia company...，主语和谓语之间插入了by a large margin做状语。表语a tiny Virginia company 后是第一层定语，由called过去分词对其进行修饰，第二层定语是whose 引导的非限定性定语从句，修饰solutions。

④Straitford makes money by selling the results of spying (covering nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like energy-services firm McDermott International.

句子主干是：Straitford makes money by selling...to...，其状语结构中含有一个复合结构：sell sth. to sb.。the results of spying 是sell 的直接宾语，括号中的现在分词短语做直接宾语的定语，对其补充说明；corporations是sell的间接宾语，介词结构like energy-services firm McDermott International做其定语。

⑤Straitford’s briefs don’t sound like the usual Washington back-and-forthing, whereby agencies avoid dramatic declarations on the chance they might be wrong.

该句子是由关系副词whereby引导的主从复合句。逗号前是主句，其主干是briefs don’t sound like back-and-forthing；关系副词whereby相当于by which，引导定语从句，修饰主句的宾语back-and-forthing，从句的主干是agencies avoid dramatic declarations。back and forth原是副词短语，意为“来回地”，文中将它动名词化了。表示“反复无常的语言，言辞躲闪”。

佳句赏析：

Among the firms making the biggest splash in the new world is Straitford, Inc, a private intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas.

句子中make the biggest splash or make a splash意思是“惹人注目，引起轰动”。“splash”（水花）极其形象地描述当时的场面。该短语形象生动，形神俱佳。又如：She has made quite a splash in literary circles with her first book. 

 

**四、全文翻译**

狂热的比尔·多诺汶（要是活着的话）肯定会喜欢网络。**这位美国间谍大王对情报着迷，他曾经在第二次世界大战时建立了战略事务办公室，后来又为中央情报局（Central Intelligence Agency）的成立打下了基础（**长难句①**）。多诺汶相信，在谍报职业这个“大游戏”中可以使用任何手段。（**长难句②**）**如今，互联网已经完全改变了买书和寄信这样的日常活动，也正在改变多诺汶曾经从事的这个职业。

最近的这次革命性的改变不仅仅是一个人偷看别人的电子邮件的问题，这样的电子间谍活动已经存在了数十年。在过去的三四年中，国际互联网已经派生出一个可称为点击谍报的完整的产业。间谍们把它称为“公开来源情报”。随着互联网的发展，它变得越来越有影响力。1995年美国中央情报局举办了一个竞赛，看谁能够收集到关于“布隆迪”最多的信息。**胜者胜出了一大截，却是弗吉尼亚一家名为“公开来源解决方案”的小公司，它的明显优势是它对电子世界的把握（**长难句③**）。**

**在这个新的电子世界中最引起轰动的是一个叫司特雷福的公司，它是得克萨斯州奥斯汀市的一个私营的情报分析公司。**（佳句）**该公司的业务是将全球各个国家（从智利到俄罗斯）侦察而得到的情报销售给“麦克德莫国际”这样的能源公司**。**（**长难句④**）**它的许多预测都可以从它的网站上www.straitford.com在线查阅。

该公司的总裁乔治·弗莱德曼说，他把网络世界视为情报收集和情报发布两方面相互增强的工具，是间谍大王的梦想。上周，他的公司正忙于从世界的偏僻角落里收集零散的信息，并预测在乌克兰将发生一场危机。“一旦这个报道发布，我们将从乌克兰突然新增500个用户登陆发布的信息，”弗莱德曼，一位前政治科学教授说，“我们将听到其中一些人的反馈。”当然公开来源的谍报活动的确有它的风险，因为很难区分正确与错误的信息。但这也正是司特雷福公司挣钱糊口的事业。

弗莱德曼在奥斯汀市依赖的是一个人数不多的雇员团体，其中几位有军事情报工作背景。他把公司的“局外人”地位视为它成功的关键。**司特雷福公司的简报听上去不像华盛顿当局常常提供的躲闪的言辞，这些政府机构往往以此来避免发布引人注目的言论，因为这些言论可能出错（**长难句⑤**）。**弗莱德曼说，司特雷福公司为其独立的声音而感到自豪。

 

 

**Text 2**

**一、文章结构总体分析**

这是一篇关于捍卫利用动物进行实验的文章，主要使用了引证、例证和推理等论证手段。

文章指出目前的问题是许多动物权益保护者并不了解生物医学的真实情况和意义，而一味地反对医学，使广大群众也受到了蒙蔽。针对这一点，作者指出科学家应该采取措施与大众多交流，避免由于人们的无知而阻碍生物医学的发展。

第一段：以艾德蒙•柏克的一句话为引子，指出：动物权利鼓吹者的言论混淆了公众的视听，因此，科学家应该对动物权利鼓吹者做出强有力的回应。

第二段：使用典型事例，并加以分析，说明普通人如何受到动物权利鼓吹者的误导。

第三段：谈到科学家向公众阐述动物实验的必要性。第一句话为本段主题句，利用说理的论证手段，说明科学家应该采取的态度。

第四段：文章采用总—分—总的结构，段首为本段主题句，最后一句为总结。着重介绍科学家应当如何与公众沟通，以及通过这种沟通可能避免产生的结果。

 

**二、试题具体解析**


 

**46.[****答案] A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者意图题**。

这道题实质上在考查考生对文章主旨要义的理解。文章开篇引用了埃德蒙·柏克的话：如果好人无所作为，一个被误导的事业就会得逞。接着谈到现在终止生物医学的研究就是这样一个事业。篇首的话在篇尾又得到了呼应：如果好人无所作为，一群不明真相的公众真的有可能扑灭医学进步的宝贵火种。显然文章的中心是在号召科学家们采取行动去阻止动物权利运动这个被误导的事业。因此A选项为作者的意图。

作者虽然在文章中批评了动物权利运动，并称之为“被误导的事业”，但是开篇引文的用意并不仅在于批评，因此B选项不恰当。C选项和D选项离引文的用意比较远。


 




 

**47.[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

文章第一段最后一句说，当人们听到医学实验虐待动物的指控时，许多人都不明白为什么有人会故意伤害动物；第二段举例说明人们毫无理由地反对动物实验；第三段结尾又说，对于不明真相的人们来说，动物实验说得好是浪费，说得不好是残忍。因此文章多次暗示，被误导的人们对动物实验的看法是“不人道，不可接受”，因此B选项是正确的；其他的A、C、D选项都只是部分地体现了这些人的观点，因为“自然”、“不可避免”和“无意义”都不是他们的观点。


 

**48.[****答案] B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者意图题**。

本题要求考生理解论据在文章中的作用，并从众多信息中找出作者的观点。文章第一段提到公众被误导而对医学实验有误解，第三段又说科学家应该多与公众交流，让他们懂得医学实验的利害关系。因此根据上下文可以知道作者在暗示人们对医学实验的过程和意义知道得太少，最明显的例子就是那位老奶奶。她说，“如果瘟疫来了，科学家将用计算机找到一种对付它的办法”，这表现了“公众对医学科学的无知”。作者在段末发出感叹：“这样好心的人们就是不明白”。正因为如此，作者接着就呼吁科学家采取行动。因此B选项是举例要说明的内容。其他A、C、D选项虽然都可以说是老奶奶对医学实验误解的具体表现，但是却不是作者要证实的观点。


 

**49.[****答案]** **A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者观点题**。

文章第三段说，科学家必须将他们的想法传达给公众，并且要使用富有同情心和通俗易懂的语言，不能使用分子生物学的语言。让公众明白动物实验与他们的生活密切相关。第四段又说，科学家应该走进中学课堂，宣传他们的研究成果，对报刊刊登的读者来信及时做出反应，科研机构应该对外开放，让人们参观。所有这些内容综合起来就是A选项“科学家应该与公众更多地交流”。其他的B、C和D选项虽然有可能是作者赞同的行为，但不是本文阐释的内容。


 




 

**50.[****答案] D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

文章最后一段提到，斯蒂芬·库柏是一个名人（well-know personality），同时他勇敢地肯定了动物研究的价值。从文中所给的信息，我们无法判断他是不是A或B 选项的内容，但是我们可以肯定他不是C 选项的内容，因为他认为动物研究是有价值的。只有D 选项是我们可以推论出来的。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

①To paraphrase 18th century statesman Edmund Burke, “all that is needed for the triumph of a misguided cause is that good people do nothing.”

该句子是不定式起首的特殊感叹句。引号中的句子主干是all...is that...。主语all后是that引导的定语从句，谓语系动词is后是that引导的表语从句。Cause在这里指的是A goal or principle served with dedication and zeal，即“目标，理想，事业”。类似结构的句子还有：To think that I shall never see her again!（真没想到我将再也见不到她了）。

②For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that comes from or is tested in animals—no meat, no fur, no medicines.

​    该句子的特点是有三个定语修饰成分。句子的主干是a grandmotherly woman...was distributing a brochure...。主语woman 后是现在分词成分staffing…做定语；宾语brochure后是that引导的定语从句做定语；这个定语从句中又含有一个that引导的定语从句修饰不定代词anything，破折号后的名词是对anything的举例说明。

③We need to make clear the connection between animal research and a grandmother’s hip replacement, a father’s bypass operation, a baby’s vaccinations, and even a pet’s shots.

   该句子的主干是We need to make clear sth., 其中宾语是the connection between animal research and...。and后是四个并列成分a grandmother’s hip replacement，a father’s bypass operation，a baby’s vaccinations和a pet’s shots。

④To those who are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.

​    该句子的特点是一个较长的介词短语to those…（对于那些人…来说）在句中充当状语。在这个状语中，those后接who引导的定语从句，其中produce 后连接了三个并列名词短语：these treatments，new treatments和vaccines。主句的主干是animal research seems wasteful and cruel。

⑤They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, lest animal rights misinformation go unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth.

该句子是由连词lest引导状语从句的主从复合句。lest所连接的状语从句里常用should或原形动词，意为“惟恐，以免”。该从句的主于是谓语是animal rights misinformation，谓语是and引导的两个动词短语go…和acquire…。

⑥Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive medical treatment.

该句子中含有一个原因状语从句和两个定语从句。主句的主干是the health research community should recruit to its cause not only…, but all those...，其中not only…but all those…都是谓语recruit的宾语，即“接纳吸收…到它的事业中”。主语之前是because引导的原因状语从句；宾语well-known personalities后接有such as Stephen Cooper对其举例说明，在Cooper之后是who引导的非限定性定语从句对其修饰限定；另一宾语all those后也接who引导的定语从句。Stakeholder原义是“赌金保管人，股东”，句子中用它来强调 “病人是在捍卫动物实验以促进生物医学发展方面最有发言权的人”，因为他们是直接受益者。

佳句赏析：

If good people do nothing，there is a real possibility that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the precious embers of medical progress.

句子中用了比喻extinguish the precious embers。embers指的是“将要熄灭的火中的灰烬，余烬”，extinguish指“熄灭（如火/希望等）”，可以想象：连灰烬都被熄灭了，必然是完全没有希望了。该比喻形象生动地表现出形势的严峻性：医学进步的宝贵火种有可能被不明真相的公众所扑灭。

  

**四、全文翻译**

**18****世纪政治家埃德蒙·柏克曾说过类似这样的话，“一个被误导的事业如果要得逞，惟一需要的就是好人无所作为”** 。（长难句①）现在就有这样一个被误导的事业，它正在寻求终止生物医学的研究，因为有一种理论说，动物有权利拒绝被作为实验对象。科学家应该对动物权利鼓吹者做出强有力的回应，因为他们的言论混淆了公众的视听，从而威胁到卫生知识和医疗的进步。动物权利运动的领导者将矛头指向生物医学研究，原因在于它依赖公共资金的资助，并且很少有人懂得卫生医疗研究的过程。当人们听到医学实验虐待动物的指控时，许多人都不明白为什么有人会故意伤害动物。

**例如，在近期的一次集市上，一位老奶奶站在动物权利宣传点前散发小册子，规劝人们不要使用动物制品和动物实验制品——包括肉类，毛皮和药物。（**长难句②**）**当被问到她是否反对免疫接种时，她问疫苗是否来自动物实验。当被告知的确如此，她回答道，“那么我不得不说，是的，我反对接种”。当被问到传染病爆发怎么办时，她说，“不用担心，科学家会找到一种方法，用计算机来解决问题”。看,这样好心的人们就是不明白。

科学家必须把他们的意思传达给公众，并且要使用有同情心和通俗易懂的语言，一般人能够明白的语言，而不要使用分子生物学的语言。**我们需要说明动物实验与祖母的髋骨更换、父亲的心脏搭桥、婴儿的免疫接种、甚至宠物的注射针剂都密切相关。（**长难句③**）对于那些不明白获得这些新的治疗方法和疫苗都必须进行动物实验的人来说，动物实验说得好是浪费，说得不好是残忍（**长难句④**）。**

有很多事情可以做。科学家可以进入中学课堂，展示他们的实验结果。**他们应该对报刊的读者来信及时做出反应，以防止动物权利的误导言论在毫无质疑的情况下横行，从而获得一副真理的面容（**长难句⑤**）。**科研机构应该对外开放，让人参观，向人们展示实验室里的动物获得了人道的对待。**最后，因为最有发言权的是病人，医疗研究机构不仅应该积极争取斯蒂芬·库柏这样的名人的支持——他对动物实验的价值勇敢地进行了肯定——而且应该争取所有接受治疗的病人的支持（**长难句⑥**）。****如果好人无所作为，一群不明真相的公众真的有可能扑灭医学进步的宝贵火种。**（佳句）

 

**Text 3** 

**一、文章结构分析**

这是一篇关于铁路公司合并可能引起垄断的文章。本文结构有一些明显的特点，首先，全文结构为总—分—总：第一段开篇点题，最后一段对全文进行总结，都属于综述部分，中间部分进行详细论述。其次，文章中间部分使用对比的写法，分别对支持和反对方的观点进行论述。从论证角度讲，文章使用了引证、例证、对比等论证手法。

第一段：铁路公司合并引起人们对垄断的关注。接着使用具体数据说明该合并趋势。

第二段：是一个典型表示对比的段落。前半段提出合并支持者的观点，中间用“but”转折之后，开始论述托运商（即，合并反对者）截然不同的态度。

第三段：详细论述托运商的担心，主要使用说理论证（reasoning）。

第四段：详细论述铁路公司的理由，除说理之外，还使用了引证法（quotation）。

第五段：对文章进行总结，重申了两方的对立，使用了说理和例证法（exemplification）。

 

**二、试题具体解析**


 

**51.[****答案] C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

回答本题的关键在于识别文章提到的几种人各自持有的观点。根据文章第二段第一句Any threat of monopoly，they argue，is removed by fierce competition from trucks可以判断这是支持兼并的人的观点，即他们认为，垄断不可能形成是因为有公路运输的激烈竞争。因此C选项“外部竞争者将继续存在”是正确选项。

A选项不正确，因为文章说的是兼并可以降低成本（第2段第1句话），而不是竞争可以降低成本。B选项也不正确，因为文章说的是服务可以更好地协调（第2段第1句话），而不是跨行业进行协调。D选项与文意正好相反，不是客户掐铁路公司的脖子，而是铁路公司掐客户的脖子（第2段最后一句话）。


 

**52.[****答案] D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题。**

本题和往年真题侧重考查作者态度的情况不同，问的是文中提到的某类人的态度而非作者本人的态度。文章第二段提到客户对合并的反映是抱怨，认为铁路公司会“掐他们的脖子”。但是，对于客户来说，垄断引起的大幅涨价并未真正到来，所以他们目前的态度应该是“忧虑”，而不是C选项 “愤怒”。第五段首句的 worry 和末句的fear 也证明了这一点。因此选项D为正确答案，其他两个选项干扰性很小。 

知识点补充：apprehensive是个多义词，意思可以是“有理解力的，能够迅速领悟的”，也可以如文中，表示“担心的，忧虑的，不安的”，如：be apprehensive of sb’s safety （担心某人的安全）。


 

**53.[****答案] C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题。**

第三段末句谈到“申诉手续繁琐、耗钱、耗时，最终还不一定能够成功”，暗示多数客户不太可能为收费高而申诉，因此C选项为正确答案。

也可以使用排除法：A选项与文意完全相反，因为没有竞争，铁路公司将高收费，而不是少收费（本段第2句）。B选项显然与事实不符，干扰在于文章说“most shippers are served by only one rail company”（大部分托运商只有来自一家铁路公司的服务），而且，文章第一段的末句就提到“明年四家大公司将控制全国90%的业务”。D选项无法从本段推出，因为文中提到的 Surface Transportation Board 虽然可以管理价格问题的申诉，但是没有提及是否可以保证公平。


 

**54.[****答案] B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**词义句意题。**

文章第四段末句为Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who wins and who loses in the marketplace？（我们是否真的想要铁路公司成为谁胜谁负的   ）。考生可以把四个选项填入空格进行尝试。更好的方法是在上下文中寻找线索。上文谈到“It’s a theory to which many economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which companies will flourish and which will fail.”（这种理论得到了多数经济学家的认同，但在实际操作中，它使铁路公司获得了一个决定谁败谁衰的权利。）那么，可以得出铁路公司处于“determining which companies will flourish and which will fail.”的地位，其中“which companies will flourish”是下句中“who wins”的近义表达，“which will fail”相当于下句中的“who loses”。因此可以得出，arbiters主要功能为“determining”（决定），即裁决者（选项B）。


 

**55.[****答案] A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题。**

铁路行业成本的问题在文章第四段和第五段都涉及。第四段谈的是铁路公司认为合并从长远来看会降低成本，第五段谈的是铁路公司互相兼并过程中耗费了运营成本。从该段第三句Yet railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another和举例中谈到的客户担心两大公司会把在兼并过程中的额外开支转嫁到他们身上，可以推知，铁路公司的相互收购耗资数亿美元，这些投资造成铁路公司的成本大幅增加，从而使客户的利益受损。因此A选项是铁路行业成本增加的主要原因。

B选项也是成本增加的原因之一（最后一段第2句），但是与收购相比，它是次要原因。另外两个选项与成本增加的关系不大。此外，从文章主题角度也可以选出正确答案。文章主要讨论的问题是铁路行业的合并，考生可以推断铁路合并肯定是增加成本的主要原因。

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

①But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads therefore have them by the throat.

​    句子主干是many shippers complain that ...。后面都是宾语从句的内容，该从句由therefore连接的两个分句构成，其中第一个分句是trucking is too costly，第二个分句是the railroads have them by the throat；在第一个分句前是for引导的介词短语引起话题。

②Shippers who feel they are being overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government’s Surface Transportation Board for rate relief, but the process is expensive, time consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.

该句是由but引导的两个分句。其中第一个分句的主干是Shippers ... have the right to appeal to ... for ...，其中，主语shippers后接who引导的定语从句。第二个分句又包含两个由and连接的并列谓语，第一个谓语为系表结构（两个表语分别为expensive和time consuming），第二个谓语为will work。

③If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue, shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so, leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line.

句子主干是... they argue ...，其他内容都是谓语argue的宾语从句。该从句的主干是if...,  shippers would do so ...。其中if引导的是条件状语从句，主语shippers后是who引导的定语从句，谓语would do so中的so指代的是if引导的条件状语从句中的主语的行为，即，switching to trucks or other forms of transportation。后面现在分词leaving…做伴随状语。

④It’s a theory to which many economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which companies will flourish and which will fail.

​    该句是由but引导的两个分句。其中第一个分句的主干是It’s a theory，后面是which 引导的定语从句，并将该从句谓语中的to前移。第二个分句主干是 ... it ... leaves railroads in the position of determining ...，后面的which companies will flourish and which will fail是determine的宾语。

⑤The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortunes, still does not earn enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic.

句子主干是The railroad industry ... does not earn enough to cover ...；主语和谓语之间插入despite its brightening fortunes，表示让步，the cost of the capital是cover的宾语，后面接的是省略连接词的定语从句it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic，对该宾语进行修饰。

佳句赏析：

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems, causing heightened concerns about monopoly.

该句简单干练，用三个并列动词将铁路公司的动向形象地描述出来。三个现在分词读起来朗朗上口，给人排比的感觉，意思一气呵成。

 

**四、全文翻译**

**近年来，铁路公司相互联合，组成了超大型集团，引起人们对垄断行为的极大关注。**（佳句）就在1995年，四家大型铁路公司占有70% 的铁路运输业务。到明年，一系列合并活动完成之后，四家铁路公司将控制90% 以上的铁路运输市场。

支持组建超大型铁路集团的人士认为，合并将导致运输成本的大幅降低，铁路公司更协调地提供服务。他们认为，在公路运输的激烈竞争面前，垄断的威胁已经不复存在。**但许多客户却抱怨说，对于长途运输的大宗货物来说，如煤炭，化学制品和粮食，公路运输成本太高，因此铁路公司就会掐他们的脖子。**（长难句①）

铁路运输业的大规模联合意味着多数客户将会依赖一家公司的服务。通常，铁路公司对这些“被控制”客户的收费要比存在其它铁路公司的竞争时高出20% - 30%。**如果客户感到他们被多收费，他们有权上诉到联邦政府的“陆路运输局”以争取价格下调，但这个过程既耗财又耗时，并且只有在真正极端特殊的情况下才有作用。**（长难句②）

对“被控制”客户进行的价格歧视，铁路公司提出的理由是，从长远来看，这样做会降低所有人的成本。**他们争论说，如果铁路公司向所有客户收取同样的平均价格的话，那么，可以使用公路运输或其它交通工具的客户将会转移，使剩下的客户来承担铁路正常运作的开销。**（长难句③）**这种理论得到了多数经济学家的认同，但在实际操作中，它使铁路公司获处于决定谁败谁衰的位置。**（长难句④）“我们是否真的想让铁路公司成为在市场上决定谁败谁荣的裁决者？”马丁•贝科维奇问道。他是一位常常代表铁路客户的华盛顿律师。

许多“被控制”客户还担心他们很快将遭受一轮新的大幅涨价。**从整体来说，虽然铁路工业有耀眼的资产，但它的收入仍然不足以支付为满足不断增长的运输需要而进行的固定资产投资。**（长难句⑤）然而铁路公司仍然继续贷款数十亿美元来进行相互合并，而华尔街也鼓励它们这样做。请想一想今年南诺弗克公司和CSX 公司兼并康雷尔公司所花的102亿美元吧。康雷尔公司1996年铁路运营纯收入为4.27亿美元,这还不足这宗交易运作成本的一半。谁来支付其余的费用呢？许多“被控制”客户担心，随着南诺弗克和CSX 公司增加对市场的控制，他们得负担这部分费用。

 


 

**Text 4** 


 

**一、文章结构总体分析**

​    这是一篇探讨医疗上花费大量财力去延缓自然死亡是否值得的文章。作者首先从死亡的不可避免性入手，指出耗费大量财力去延缓自然死亡是不可取的，但同时作者亦指出歧视和放弃对老人的照顾也是不对的。最后他通过与其他国家的比较得出了一个解决办法：更多地研究提高人们生活质量的普通方法。

第一、二段：提出即使有再伟大的医疗卫生体系，死亡也是无法战胜的。但是我们现在却不能面对这个现实，其表现就是人们把正常的死亡当作问题来解决，在医疗方面不择手段。

第三、四段：指出由于政府用于医疗卫生的资金与日俱增，有人呼吁停止某一年龄以上人群的医疗费用。

最后，作者先通过举例说明老年人仍然可以保持创造力，对上面的观点进行反驳；接着呼吁社会应该把资金更多地投入到研究提高人们生活质量的平常方法上。

 

**二、试题具体解析**

**56.[****答案] C**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

文章第一句说，据说在英国死亡是迫在眉睫的，在加拿大死亡是不可避免的，而在加利福尼亚死亡是可以选择的。言下之意，美国人相信死亡是选择的结果。如果他不想死，他就不会死，因为他们的医院可以治好一切病症。因此C选项是这句话暗含的意思。

B选项将美国人的现状与过去比较，而篇首句中的比较对象是美国、英国和加拿大。选择D选项是没有理解原句中的optional（可选择的，随意的）一词，根据下文谈到的Failing hips replaced，clinical depression controlled，cataracts removed也可知道，这里强调的是人们可以借助发达的医疗技术来延缓和选择什么时候死。A选项毫无道理，事实上，美国人比其他国家的人更害怕死亡，所以不惜投入金钱，期望医疗技术能够延缓他们的生命。

词汇补充：vain带有明显的贬义，意为“徒劳的，虚荣的，自负的，愚蠢的”。


 

**57.[****答案] A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者意图题**。

本题考查的是考生对论证过程的理解。论据是为了说明论点的，文章中的任何一句话都不能孤立地去理解，而应该结合文章大意或上下文去理解。举例往往是为了说明上下文中提到的某个论点。文章第二段说，“由于有第三方支付我们的医疗费用，我们常常要求用尽一切可能的医疗手段，即使它们不会有任何作用”。然后文章举了癌症病人的例子去证明这一点。显然作者这里要说明的是如果治疗没有作用仍然坚持进行，那么它就是一种浪费。因此A选项是作者举例所要说明的内容，D选项和文章内容不符。

考生误选B或C 选项，是由于下文中提到“医生由于不能治愈疾病，同时又担心病人失去希望，所以常常采用极端大胆的治疗方法，这些方法远远超出了科学能够认同的界限”，但是结合文章来看，其目的是说服人们勇敢接受死亡这一自然规律，因此这里举例应是说明人们浪费了医疗资源，而不是仅仅说明医生或治疗方案怎样。


 

**58.[****答案] B**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者态度题**。

本题要求考生判断作者对文章提到的人物的话语的态度。人物所说的话也是作者引用的一种论据，也是为了说明论点的。根据题干中的人名Lamm定位到文章第三段末句：理查德·拉姆提出老年人有义务死去，以便给年轻人让位。接着在第四段作者立即补充道，“I would not go that far.（我不会说得这么绝对）”，并且在后面开始举例说明老人仍然有创造力。从这里至少排除了作者完全赞成该人观点的可能。但是考生不能马上选择A选项，否则就是断章取义了。在第五段首句，“Yet”一词表示了转折，表述了作者另外一个角度的意见，谈到社会对医疗的投资太多，而对提高老人生活质量的投资太少。从作者的论述中可推断出，作者希望人们接受死亡这个自然规律，即在一定程度上赞同拉姆的观点，但是却不愿意像拉姆一样走极端。因此B选项中较中庸的态度是最佳答案。A、D选项都很绝对，C 选项不准确。


 

**59.[****答案]** **D**

​    **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

文章最后一段说，日本和瑞典在医疗方面的投资要少得多，但是人民的寿命长得多，健康也好得多。接着作者提出倡议，与其将资金徒劳地花在没有希望的治疗上，还不如投入到较一般的治疗中，以提高人们的生活质量。可见文章在暗示日本、瑞典两个国家在医疗卫生事业的资助更合理，D选项正确。

60.**[****答案] C**

   **[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**文章主旨题**。

本题考查考生对文章主旨要义的理解能力。实际上考生只需要把各段的主题句串起来，基本上对全文就有了一个总体的把握。主题句一般落在首句和末句，这篇文章也不例外，除了第三段首句为具体的数据无法充当观点及最后一段的主题句在末句外，其它都是首句。第一段提到，在美国死亡是可以选择的；第二段说，死亡是正常现象，我们的基因决定我们即使在最理想的条件下也会解体和灭亡。第三段讲，有人认为对83岁以上的老人应该停止支付医疗费，老人有责任为年轻人让位。第四段作者指出自己的观点不会和上一段的观点那样过分。第五段指出，人们不应用无效而昂贵的手段去延长生命，而应该提高生活质量。因此全文的中心思想是劝告人们接受死亡，C选项正确。

作者在第四段已经举例反驳了B 选项的这种偏激的看法，A选项和D选项是提到的事实，不是观点。

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

①But not even a great health-care system can cure death—and our failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.

​    该句子比较简短，有俩处难点：一是破折号前分句中的否定词not，它的位置前移，实际上是修饰句子的谓语can cure的，即“不能治疗”；二是破折号后分句中的代词that，该分句的主干是our failure threatens this greatness，而其中的that reality指的是破折号前分句的内容。

②We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved.

​    该句子的结构呈对称型。它由yet引导的两个分句组成，前一分句的主干是We all understand that，that指代上一句的内容，状语at some level在句末；后一分句的主干是we treat death as a problem，状语as medical consumers在句首。

​    ③Physicians—frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient—too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

​    该句子的特点是其主语和谓语被一个较长的分词结构隔离。句子主干是Physicians...offer aggressive treatment...，破折号之间是and连接的两个分词结构frustrated by和 fearing loss并列修饰主语Physicians，做定语。介词结构beyond what is justified修饰宾语treatment，做定语。

④These leaders are living proof that prevention works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age.

​    该句子中含有两个that引导的并列的同位语从句。句子主干是These leaders are living proof that...and that...。在第二个从句中，又含有that引导的定语从句修饰其宾语health problems。 

⑤I also know that people in Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than we have.

​    该句子是宾语从句中套定语从句。句子的主干是I also know that...，其中 that引导宾语从句；宾语从句的主干是people have achieved longer, healthier lives than we have，而介词短语in Japan and Sweden在句中做状语，其后两个逗号之间的插入成分，即that引导定语从句修饰countries，对这两个国家进行解释说明。

佳句赏析

①It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional.

​    该句子结构工整、对称，是排比句。重复单词予以省略，干净利落，用词简略到位。

②Failing hips can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minute surgical procedure.

​    该句子由三个并列分句构成，其中第二个和第三个分句是省略句，省去了can be。这种省略句在结构上简洁明了，在文中，更是通过音节的越来越短从意义上强调“人们通过手术越来越容易解决疾病的问题”。

**四、全文翻译**

**据说，在英国死亡迫在眉睫，在加拿大死亡不可避免，在加利福尼亚死亡可以选择**（佳句①）**。**这种说法并不奇怪。在过去的一个世纪里，美国人的寿命几乎延长了一倍。**髋骨不行了可以更换，临床的忧郁症得到了控制，白内障在30分钟手术中便可以切除**（佳句②）**。**这些进步给老年人口带来的高质量生活在50年前我刚从事医学时是不可想象的。**但是即使有一个伟大的医疗卫生体系，死亡也是无法战胜的——而我们不能面对这个现实却正危及着我们这个时代的伟大**（长难句①）。

死亡是正常现象；我们的基因决定我们即使在最理想的环境里也会解体和灭亡。**我们所有人在某种程度上都懂得这一点，但是作为医疗消费者，我们却常将死亡视为一个问题来解决**（长难句②）。由于医疗费用由第三方支付，我们常常要求用尽所有的医疗手段，即使它们不会有任何作用。最明显的例子是晚期癌症的治疗。**医生由于不能治愈疾病，同时又担心病人失去希望，于是常常采用极端大胆的治疗方法，这些方法远远超出了科学能够认同的界限**（长难句③）。

1950年,美国在医疗卫生方面的开支是127亿美元。2002年这项开支将达到15 400亿。任何人都明白这个趋势不可持续下去，但是很少有人愿意去扭转它。有些学者总结说，资金有限的政府应该停止支付医疗费用来延缓某一个年龄以上人群的寿命——比如83岁左右。据说，科罗拉多州前州长理查德·拉姆曾经说，老年多病者“有义务死去和让位”，以让更年轻、更健康的人们去发挥他们的潜能。

我不会说得这么绝对,毕竟现在精力充沛的人们通常能工作到60岁，甚至更久，并仍然具有惊人的创造力。78岁的Viacom公司总裁萨姆勒·雷斯顿开玩笑说他只有53岁。最高法院法官桑德拉·欧康奈70有余，前卫生局医务主任C·库普80来岁还出任了一个互联网公司的总裁。**这些领导人就是活生生的证据，证明对疾病的防治是有意义的，证明我们能够对付年龄带来的健康问题**（长难句④）**。**作为一名年仅68岁的人，我希望像他们一样在老龄阶段保持创造力。

然而在这样的追求中，一个社会能够承担的费用是有限的。作为一名医生，我深知最昂贵和最激进的手段也可能是无效的和痛苦的。**我也深知在医疗开销少得多的日本和瑞典,人们获得了比我们更长的、更健康的寿命**（长难句⑤）**。**作为一个国家，我们可能在寻求不可能奏效的治疗方法上花钱太多，而在研究能提高人们生活质量的更平常的方法上花钱太少。

 

Section IV: Writing (20 points)

\66. 参考范文

As is shown in the two pictures, the same flower has different fate when put in different situations. When there is protection, the flower blooms beautifully. However, when exposed directly to rain and storm, the flower quickly withers. We can safely come to the conclusion that greenhouse flowers cannot withstand rain and storm.

The same is true with our children. As the one-child policy is adopted in China, more and more parents overprotect their children. With everything done for them and every need satisfied by their parents or grandparents, these only children seem to be healthy, happy and high-spirited. But when they leave home, they become disappointed and frustrated. Facing harsh things they have never experienced before, such as competition from peers, criticism from supervisors, pressure for deadlines and restriction for discipline, they will be at a loss, miserable or even desperate. In fact, the more protection they get from their parents, the less ability they acquire. Parents’ love for their children turns out to be a disaster.

Children, like flowers, should be treated with care, but reasonable and sensible ways of doing things will help to bring about more fruitful results, if we not only love our children but also teach them how to love, our love will be passed down from generation to generation; if we not only solve problems for our children but also encourage them to solve problems, our diligence and ingenuity will make our life more meaningful and worthwhile.

Comparisons were drawn between the development of television in the 20th century and the diffusion of printing in the 15th and 16th centuries. Yet much had happened . As was discussed before, it was not  the 19th century that the newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic , following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book and in the  of the periodical. It was during the same time that the communications revolution  up, beginning with transport, the railway, and leading  through the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and motion pictures  the 20th-century world of the motor car and the air plane. Not everyone sees that process in . It is important to do so.

It is generally recognized, , that the introduction of the computer in the early 20th century,  by the invention of the integrated circuit during the 1960s, radically changed the process,  its impact on the media was not immediately . As time went by, computers became smaller and more powerful, and they became “personal” too, as well as , with display becoming sharper and storage  increasing. They were thought of, like people,  generations, with the distance between generations much .

It was within the computer age that the term “information society” began to be widely used to describe the  within which we now live. The communications revolution has  both work and leisure and how we think and feel both about place and time, but there have been  views about its economic, political, social and cultural implications. “Benefits” have been weighed  “harmful” outcomes. And generalizations have proved difficult.

**Part A**

**Directions:**

Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing [A], [B], [C] or [D]. Mark your answers on **ANSWER SHEET 1**. (40 points)

**Text 1**

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.

Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ convention, of a story which works well because the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and stomps over to a table by himself. “Who is that?” the new arrival asked St. Peter. “Oh, that’s God,” came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks he’s a doctor.”

If you are part of the group, which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties. With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system.

If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural. Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and unforced manner. Often it’s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a light-hearted remark.

Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote “If at first you don’t succeed, give up” or a play on words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration and understatements. Look at your talk and pick out a few words or sentences which you can turn about and inject with humor.

\41.   To make your humor work, you should ________.

[A] take advantage of different kinds of audience

[B] make fun of the disorganized people

[C] address different problems to different people（C）

[D] show sympathy for your listeners

\42.   The joke about doctors implies that, in the eyes of nurses, they are ________.

[A] impolite to new arrivals

[B] very conscious of their godlike role

[C] entitled to some privileges（B）

[D] very busy even during lunch hours

\43.   It can be inferred from the text that public services ________.

[A] have benefited many people

[B] are the focus of public attention

[C] are an inappropriate subject for humor（D）

[D] have often been the laughing stock

\44.   To achieve the desired result, humorous stories should be delivered ________.

[A] in well-worded language

[B] as awkwardly as possible

[C] in exaggerated statements（D）

[D] as casually as possible

\45.   The best title for the text may be ________.

[A] Use Humor Effectively

[B] Various Kinds of Humor

[C] Add Humor to Speech（A）

[D] Different Humor Strategies

**Text 2**

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has resulted in robotics -- the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And if scientists have yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.

As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robot-drivers. And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics, there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy -- far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.

But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves -- goals that pose a real challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific error,” says Dave Lavery, manager of a robotics program at NASA, “we can’t yet give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to reliably interact with a dynamic world.”

Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite a spell of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.

What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented -- and human perception far more complicated -- than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error of a machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer systems on Earth can’t approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it.

\46.   Human ingenuity was initially demonstrated in ________.

[A] the use of machines to produce science fiction

[B] the wide use of machines in manufacturing industry

[C] the invention of tools for difficult and dangerous work（C）

[D] the elite’s cunning tackling of dangerous and boring work

\47.   The word “gizmos” (Line 1, Paragraph 2) most probably means ________.

[A] programs

[B] experts

[C] devices（C）

[D] creatures

\48.   According to the text, what is beyond man’s ability now is to design a robot that can ________.

[A] fulfill delicate tasks like performing brain surgery

[B] interact with human beings verbally

[C] have a little common sense（D）

[D] respond independently to a changing world

\49.   Besides reducing human labor, robots can also ________.

[A] make a few decisions for themselves

[B] deal with some errors with human intervention

[C] improve factory environments（B）

[D] cultivate human creativity

\50.   The author uses the example of a monkey to argue that robots are ________.

[A] expected to copy human brain in internal structure

[B] able to perceive abnormalities immediately

[C] far less able than human brain in focusing on relevant information（C）

[D] best used in a controlled environment

**Text 3**

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?

The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports. Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the short term.

Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than in the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on pump prices than in the past.

Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy, energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest *Economic Outlook* that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies -- to which heavy industry has shifted -- have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed.

One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic decline. *The Economist’s* commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.

\51.   The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is ________.

[A] global inflation

[B] reduction in supply

[C] fast growth in economy（B）

[D] Iraq’s suspension of exports

\52.   It can be inferred from the text that the retail price of petrol will go up dramatically if ________.

[A] price of crude rises

[B] commodity prices rise

[C] consumption rises（D）

[D] oil taxes rise

\53.   The estimates in *Economic Outlook* show that in rich countries ________.

[A] heavy industry becomes more energy-intensive

[B] income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices

[C] manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed（D）

[D] oil price changes have no significant impact on GDP

\54.   We can draw a conclusion from the text that ________.

**Text 4**

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications for how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.

Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect,” a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects -- a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen -- is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to control terminally ill patients’ pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the patient.

Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death.”

George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. “It’s like surgery,” he says. “We don’t call those deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their suicide.”

On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying.

Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, *Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life*. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying” as the twin problems of end-of-life care.

The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospices, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.

Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical initiatives translate into better care. “Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering,” to the extent that it constitutes “systematic patient abuse.” He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear… that painful deaths are presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should result in license suspension.”

\56.   From the first three paragraphs, we learn that ________.

[A] doctors used to increase drug dosages to control their patients’ pain

[B] it is still illegal for doctors to help the dying end their lives

[C] the Supreme Court strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide（B）

[D] patients have no constitutional right to commit suicide

 

\57.   Which of the following statements is true according to the text?

[A] Doctors will be held guilty if they risk their patients’ death.

[B] Modern medicine has assisted terminally ill patients in painless recovery.

[C] The Court ruled that high-dosage pain-relieving medication can be prescribed.（C）

[D] A doctor’s medication is no longer justified by his intentions.

\58.   According to the NAS’s report, one of the problems in end-of-life care is ________.

[A] prolonged medical procedures

[B] inadequate treatment of pain

[C] systematic drug abuse（B）

[D] insufficient hospital care

\59.   Which of the following best defines the word “aggressive” (Line 3, Paragraph 7)?

[A] Bold

[B] Harmful

[C] Careless（A）

[D] Desperate

\60.   George Annas would probably agree that doctors should be punished if they ________.

[A] manage their patients incompetently

[B] give patients more medicine than needed

[C] reduce drug dosages for their patients（D）

[D] prolong the needless suffering of the patients

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (10 points)

Almost all our major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of behavior, but we have been slow to develop the science from which such a technology might be drawn. 61) One difficulty is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of character, human nature, and so on. Physics and biology once followed similar practices and advanced only when they discarded them. 62) The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly because the explanatory items often seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds of explanations have been hard to find. The environment is obviously important, but its role has remained obscure. It does not push or pull, it selects, and this function is difficult to discover and analyze. 63) The role of natural selection in evolution was formulated only a little more than a hundred years ago, and the selective role of the environment in shaping and maintaining the behavior of the individual is only beginning to be recognized and studied. As the interaction between organism and environment has come to be understood, however, effects once assigned to states of mind, feelings, and traits are beginning to be traced to accessible conditions, and a technology of behavior may therefore become available. It will not solve our problems, however, until it replaces traditional prescientific views, and these are strongly entrenched. Freedom and dignity illustrate the difficulty. 64) They are the possessions of the autonomous (self-governing) man of traditional theory, and they are essential to practices in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and given credit for his achievements. A scientific analysis shifts both the responsibility and the achievement to the environment. It also raises questions concerning “values.” Who will use a technology and to what ends? 65) Until these issues are resolved, a technology of behavior will continue to be rejected, and with it possibly the only way to solve our problems.

**一、文章总体分析**

本文主要介绍了计算机的发展对通信革命及人们的生存方式产生的影响。文章第一段从早期的通信革命入手，指出在15、16世纪和20世纪之间发生了很多事情，特别是通信革命加快了步伐。第二段接着提到20世纪计算机的出现极大地改变了这一进程。第三段指出随着计算机的发展，我们步入了一个信息社会。在计算机影响下，通信革命改变了我们的工作和休闲方式，也影响了我们的思考和感知方式。在结尾部分，文章提到，当然，关于这种通信革命在经济、政治、社会和文化各方面的影响是利大于弊还是弊大于利，还存在争议。

 

**二、试题具体解析**

**21.** **[****答案]** **A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**时间副词的用法辨析**。

解此题关键看两个方面，一是理解文章第一句话的含义：人们曾对20世纪电视的发展以及15世纪和16世纪印刷术的传播进行了比较。二是注意转折连词yet的用法，yet一般标志着接下来的内容与前面的内容出现了较大的不同，如：She said she would be late, yet she arrived on time.（她说她会迟到，但她却准时到达了）。文中第二句话结构非常简单，主语和谓语都无法体现与第一句话的强烈对照，这时只能通过空格里填入的时间状语来体现了，因此这个时间副词应与第一句话中的时间状语in the 20th century和 in the 15th and 16th centuries相呼应并对照。接下来关键看这个时间副词表示的是哪个时间段，15、16世纪之前，20世纪之后还是两者之间。其实我们从下文中的the 19th century也可以推断出正确答案是between，即“然而，在这两个时段之间却发生了很多事情”。

\22. **[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**固定句型**。

空格所在的句子是一个强调句型：it was + 时间状语 + that。四个选项中能与not搭配的只有until，not until表示“直到……才……”，整个句意是“直到十九世纪，报纸才成为电子时代到来前主要的……”。如：It was not until the afternoon that he begun to tackle the problem.（直到下午他才开始解决问题）。

知识点补充：在这种强调状语的结构中，表示状语的成分可以是单词、词组或句子。强调句子时可以是主语从句、宾语从句或状语从句。如：It was at an evening party that I first met her.（强调地点状语）；It was because the water had risen that they could not cross the river.（强调原因状语从句，引导词只能用because，不能用since，as或why）；It is what you will do that is essential.（强调主语从句）。

\23. **[****答案]** **C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**名词词义辨析**。

本题相关部分是the newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic_  3  _, following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book，其中in the wake of 意为“紧跟…之后，接踵而来”，如：Outbreaks of disease occurred in the wake of the drought.（那场旱灾过后，疾病肆虐）。因此整个句子的含义是“报纸继宣传册和书之后成为电子时代到来前主要的__ 3_  _”从句意来看，空格处填入的名词应概括newspaper、pamphlet和book的共同特点，根据常识，报纸、宣传册和图书都只能是传播信息的媒介（medium），而不是方法或措施。Medium可特指“大众传播手段，包括报纸、杂志、广播或电视等”，如：Commercial television is a medium for advertising.（商业电视是一种广告媒介）。

词汇补充：注意means和medium都可以表示借以成就某事或达到某目的人或物。means (单复数同形)可以指人或物，其含义为“手段”或“工具”。这个词不仅用于具体的东西，也可以用于抽象的意念。如：Thoughts of one individual could be communicated to another by means of speech（一个人的思想能够借助于语言传递给另一个人）；medium 的含义是“媒介，手段”，通过它能完成、传输或转移某种事物的东西：如：Air is a medium of sound.（空气是声音传播的媒体）。

method 所表示的“方法”可以指做某件事的具体步骤或程序，也可以指抽象概念“条理”，如：To do this, scientists have to devise methods using radar and underwater television.（为此，科学家还要设计出使用雷达和水下电视的方法）；measures表示“手段，策略，为达到目的采取的行动，权宜之计”，如：They took strong measures against dangerous drivers.（他们对危害公众的司机采取强硬的措施）。

\24. **[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义 + 介词短语辨析**。

文章相关部分是newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic medium, following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book and in the   4   of the periodical，从结构上来看，现在分词结构following in the wake of 和介词短语in the   4   of 是并列成分，都做主句的伴随状语，newspaper，pamphlet and book，periodical也是三个平行的部分，它们之间的关系是通过in the wake of和in the   4   of两个部分来体现的。分词结构following in the wake of…意为“随着宣传册和书的出现以后”，体现了时间上的先后。因此空格处的动词构成的短语应既需要与分词结构表并列含义，又需要体现newspaper和periodical之间的时间关系。四个选项从意义上来看，只有B符合。

\25. **[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**动词短语辨析**。

本题要求考生判断哪个动词可以与up搭配，构成短语动词，且符合文意。该动作的发出者是前面的主语communication revolution。根据语义，恰当选项是speeded up，表示“通信革命加速发展”。文中所在句子用了强调结构It was during the same time that，强调时间状语19世纪，表明在这一时期不但报纸成为主要媒介，而且通信革命也取得了重大的成果：运输业、铁路、电报、电话、无线电、电影都在发展。

知识点补充：与up搭配组成的短语动词还包括：beat up（毒打），choke up（说不出话），dress up（盛装），end up（结束），hold up（阻止，妨碍），mix up（混淆），play up（强调），sign up（签约），take up（从事），wash up（洗餐具）等。

例句补充：The child gathered up his toys and put them away.（孩子把他的玩具收拾起来放好）；I worked up this business from nothing.（我在一无所有的情况下把这个事业逐步发展起来的，或，我白手起家）；Trade has been slack for the past six months, but it is now picking up.（过去六个月里商业一直很萧条，但现在情况正在好转）。

\26.  [A] (lead) on引导，率领……继续前进

​    [B] (lead) out开始，领舞伴起舞

[C] over不与lead搭配

[D] (lead) off（begin）开始

**[****答案]** **A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**短语动词搭配 + 副词词义辨析**。

事实上本题和下一个题目可以一起解答。因为第六空和第七空是所在句子整体中不可分割的两个部分。考生首先需判断选项中哪个副词可以与lead和through搭配。首先排除over，它不能与lead搭配。从结构上看，空格所在部分中的beginning with…和leading…都是现在分词状语成分，说明通信革命是怎样加速发展的：开始于运输和铁路，接着通过电报、电话、收音机和电影的发展，直到二十世纪的汽车和飞机。四个选项只有副词on可以表示“继续，向前”的含义，用在句子中强调“电报、电话、收音机和电影行业推动通信革命的继续发展”。

\27. **[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**介词用法辨析**。

根据上一题的分析，句子空格处需要一个介词和前面的begin with，lead on through一起来表达通信革命发展的全过程。选项中只有into符合，而且它和前面的leading相呼应，表达“进入20世纪的汽车和飞机时代”。

**28. [****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**句内语义 + 介词短语搭配**。

本题要求考生判断哪个名词和介词in搭配构成副词短语。空格所在句子是Not everyone sees that process in   8  （并不是每个人都…地看待这个过程）。首先排除concept和dimension，它们一般不和in搭配，即使搭配了，所表达的含义“在观念上看待这个过程”和“在尺度上看待这个过程”也不符合文意。in effect为固定搭配，如：They have no formal contract, but he is, in effect, her manager.（他们之间没有正式合同，但他实际上是她的经理），但它在文中能表达的含义“实际上看待这个过程”也不符合逻辑；只有in perspective放入句中，表示“并不是每一个人都能正确地看待这一问题”。

知识点补充：in perspective和in one’s right perspective都是固定搭配，都表示“正确、如实地（观察事物）”，如：see problems in their right perspective（如实地看待问题）。

另外，该句中，代词everyone与not搭配使用，表部分否定，意思是“不是每个人”。类似的代词或副词还有all，both，every，everyday，everybody，many，everything，entirely，absolutely，always，completely，often，wholly等，它们和not一起表达出“并非都是，不是每个都是”的含义。如：Both of them are not my brothers.（他们两个不全是我的兄弟）。I do not remember all those formulas.（这些公式我并非全都记得）。

**29.[****答案]** **C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**逻辑关系**。

从结构上看，空格所在句子是一个it做形式主语的完整的主语从句It is generally recognized that the introduction of the computer radically changed the process。空格由两个逗号隔开，在主语从句中是插入语。从四个选项看，这里需填入一个逻辑连接词，表明这个句子和其前文之间的逻辑关系。

从语义上看，第一段主要论述在15、16世纪和20世纪之间发生了很多事情，如：报纸等媒介的出现和通信革命的发展。第二段一、二句综合指出正确看待这个过程很重要。从空格所在这一句开始，文章提出“计算机的出现极大地改变了这个进程”，可以判断这里的逻辑关系为转折。选项中只有however表转折。

知识点补充：像however这类逻辑连接副词在句中的位置可以是句首、句中或句尾，而当在用于句中时，与句子其他部分既可用逗号也可用分号隔开，如：①However, not everybody agreed. ②The visitor came to the door; however, it was too late for him to get in. ③The composition is all right; there is room for improvement, however.

**30.[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**过去分词辨析**。

空格所在部分  10   by the invention of the integrated circuit during the 1960s是插入成分，插在了that引导的主语从句的主语the introduction of the computer和谓语radically changed之间，修饰从句的主语。从选项可看出空格处将填入过去分词，考生关键要判断主语“计算机在20世纪早期问世”和插入成分“集成电路在20世纪60年代发明”之间是什么联系，显然这两件事是时间先后关系。从词义上来看，只有follow表示时间先后关系，符合题意。本题最具干扰的选项是brought，但考生注意20世纪初期出现的电脑不可能由比它还晚（20世纪60年代）出现的集成电路所带来。

31.**[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**逻辑关系**。

在做本题之前，先做第12题比较好。空格前文提到，计算机的出现大大改变了这种进程，接着空格下文又说它对媒体的影响没有立即见效。显然，这里的逻辑关系为让步。四个选项中，只有although符合要求，意为“极大地改变了这一进程。虽然对媒体的影响并没有立即见效。” 

**32.[****答案]** **A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义 + 形容词词义辨析**。

空格所在句子是its impact on the media was not immediately   12  ，其中its指代的是the computer’s。首先排除plausible，因为我们不能说“影响不是立即似是而非的”。其次，根据上下文的逻辑，考生可推出虽然计算机的影响很大，但这个影响不是一蹴而就的，它刚出现时应该没有像现在这样得到这么广泛的使用，因此它对媒体的影响不是立刻就很明显的（apparent）。desirable更强调主观上的愿望，如：a home computer with many desirable features.（有许多理想性能的家庭计算机）。但计算机的影响不是我们主观上能决定的。

**33.[****答案]** **A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**句内语义 + 形容词词义辨析**。

从结构上来看，空格所在句子中的代词they指代前面的computers，逗号后的and连接了两个并列句子，即上句的smaller and more powerful与下文的personal as well as   13   相对应。上句的smaller和powerful在含义上有转折，意为“虽然越来越小却越来越强”，因此空格所填入的词也应与personal相对照。如果从字面上理解personal，它的含义是“私人的、个人的”，universal可以是它的反义词，但universal多做定语，强调“普遍性”，如；universal interest（普遍感兴趣），而且它在文中表达的含义“不仅被普遍使用，也被个人使用”也不符合逻辑；只有institutional与personal 相对应，指出“电脑不再仅仅是团体而且也成了个人使用的工具”，符合文意。

例句补充：Technical innovation is instrumental in improving the qualities of products.（技术革新有助于提高产品的质量）

**34.[****答案]** **C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**名词词义辨析**。

从结构上看，空格所在句子是with引导的分词独立结构：with display（逻辑主语）becoming sharper（现在分词结构） and storage  14  （逻辑主语）increasing（现在分词），来修饰前面的主句做状语。从语义上看，“计算机也成了个人工具，是随着其显示效果（display）越来越清晰（sharper）和存储…的提高”，因此空格和storage搭配后应指“（计算机的）存储能力”。考生关键要判断哪个名词能与storage搭配。四个选项都可以表示“能力”，但只有capacity可以指承受力或容纳力，和storage是固定搭配，表“存储能力”。例如：The hall has a seating capacity of 200 people（大厅可容纳200人）。

知识点补充：ability指去做某件事情的能力（精神的或生理的），如children’s ability to learn（孩子们的学习能力）；capability强调生长、发展或成功的一种潜能。如：The little girl has great capability as a singer and should be trained.（这个小女孩很有当歌手的才能，应该加以训练）；faculty指内在的、天生的力量或能力，如：the faculty to learn languages（学语言的能力）。

**35.[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**介词短语辨析**。

空格所在句子是They were thought of, like people,    15    generations，其中主语they指的仍然是computers，插入语意为“像人一样”，谓语是被动语态形式were thought of，指“被考虑，被想”，可见，空格和generations（一代人，世代，衍生代）一起做状语，修饰谓语，说明电脑是怎样被看待考虑的。因此考生重点要区分A、B选项，A 选项by means of强调“用某种方式或手段”，而B选项in terms of可以强调用某个字眼、措辞及它所传达的概念，如：Give the answer in terms of a percentage.（用百分比来回答）。根据文意，“计算机与人一样，都可以按照代（generations）来划分”，这里使用generation更多地是借用这个词和它的概念，因此正确选项为B。

例句补充：Thoughts are expressed by means of words.（思想用词汇来表达）；The work is not very profitable in terms of cash, but I am getting valuable experience from it.（这个工作从钱的角度来说不是非常有利可图，但我从中获得了宝贵经验）；He would make no concession in regard to his own rights.（他在关于自己权利的方面不会作出让步）；That isn’t in line with my ideas at all.（那和我的想法根本不一致）。

**36.[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**习惯搭配**。

本题要求考生判断哪个形容词的比较级可以修饰the distance。选项中只有smaller可以，表示“距离减小”。注意，英文中不能用near形容distance来表达“距离近”，而只用small或big这类的词来形容距离的远近。许多考生选择了A或C，是因为受到了中文思维的影响，觉得距离可以是深浅和远近。

**37.[****答案]** **A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**名词词义辨析**。

空格所在句子是一个强调句型It was within the computer age that…，其大意是：正是在这个计算机时代，“信息社会”开始被广泛用来描述我们现在所生活的……。information society描述的当然是society，因此考生关键要判断哪个选项和society属于同一语义范畴，显然我们不能说society是“范围（range/scope）”或“领土（territory）”，而只能说是一种“环境或背景（context）”。

**38.[****答案]** **C** 

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**动词词义辨析**。

空格所在句子是The communications revolution has    18    both work and leisure and how we think and feel both about place and time，因此考生需判断哪个动词可以描述句子主语“通信革命”对宾语“我们的工作和休闲方式以及对时间和空间的思考和感知方式”所做的动作。显然influenced是正确选项，句意为“通信革命影响了我们的众多方式”，其他三个选项和work和leisure搭配后从语义上都讲不通。

例句补充：I have always regarded him highly.（我总把他看得很高）；I wrote down whatever impressed me during the journey.（我记下旅行过程中使我感动的所有事物）；The new manager effected several changes in the company.（新来的经理在公司里促成了好几次改革）。

**39.[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**上下文语义+ 形容词词义辨析**。

本题要求考生判断哪个形容词可与view搭配，并符合文意。首先排除distracting，它不和view搭配。其次，从转折连词but可知空格所在部分there have been   19    view表示的意思和前文相反。前文指出“通信革命影响了我们工作、休闲及思考和感知的方式”，空格所在句子指出“但是关于其在经济、政治、社会和文化上的含义的看法却…”。此外，从下文中的benefits和harmful的对比以及最后一句的And generalizations have proved difficult（现在形成统一的看法还有困难）也可以知道，人们对这个通信革命影响的看法是褒贬不一的，，因此，该看法是有争议的（controversial），而不是竞争的（competitive）或不合理的（irrational）。

**40.[****答案]** **C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**习惯搭配**。

解答本题，考生关键要知道weigh sth. against sth.或sth. is weighed against sth.是固定搭配，意为“权衡，斟酌”，如：weigh one plan against another（比较一计划与另一计划的优劣）。空格所在句子的含义是“把利益和产生的弊端进行了权衡”。

三、**全文翻译**

​    人们曾对20世纪电视的发展以及15世纪和16世纪印刷术的传播进行了比较。然而，在这两个时段之间发生了很多事情。正如前面所讲的，直到十九世纪，报纸才继宣传册和书之后，伴随着期刊的出现，成为电子时代到来前主要的传播手段。在同一时间，通信革命也加快了步伐，先从运输和铁路开始，紧接着是电报、电话、收音机和电影，直到二十世纪的汽车和飞机。

​    并不是每一个人都能正确地看待（通信革命发展）这一进程，但这一点非常重要。然而，人们普遍认识到二十世纪初期计算机的出现，及随后六十年代集成电路的发明，在极大程度上改变了这一进程，虽然它对媒体的影响并没有立即见效。随着时间的推移，计算机变得越来越小，功能却更加强。它们不仅被单位，也被个人使用。计算机的图像显示变得更加清晰，储存容量也在增加。它们被看作和人一样，可以分成几代。每一代的距离也在缩小。正是在计算机时代，“信息社会”这个词语开始被广泛地用于描述我们现实的生活环境。通信革命改变了我们的工作和休闲方式，同时也改变了我们对时间和空间的思考和感知方式。但对这一革命在经济、政治、社会和文化上的含义，人们还有争议。人们把利益和产生的弊端进行了权衡，但很难得出一个概括性的结论。

 

**Section III: Reading Comprehension (50 points)**

**Text 1**

**一、文章结构总体分析**

本文是关于幽默的一篇说明文，旨在教会读者如何使用幽默。文章从三个层次讲述使用幽默时应该注意的问题，并多次举例说明。

第一段：第一句话是主题句，说明为了达到幽默的效果，必须知道如何识别听话者共有的经历和问题，针对不同的听众谈不同的幽默话题。该段主要使用说理的论证手段。

第二段：举例证明上面的观点。

第三段：推理说明为什么第一段提出的方法会达到幽默的效果。

第四段：谈论幽默很重要的一个方面是注意练习，让它显得自然随意。

第五段：举例说明获得幽默的重要方法——主动寻找幽默。

 

**二、试题具体解析**


 

**41.[****答案]** **C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**段落主旨题**。

本题考查的是局部信息，考生关键要理解第一段。该段首句指出，如果你想在谈话中用幽默使人发笑，你就必须知道如何辨别共同的经历和共同的问题。接着作者又对此进行了解释，即：你的幽默必须与听众相关，显示你是他们中的一员，或你理解他们的处境并赞成他们的观点。作者在第三句得出结论，即“Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different（针对不同的听众，谈及不同的问题）”。由此可知，C选项恰好是对该段中心的概括，为正确答案。

A选项虽然在某种程度上谈到了“不同的听众”的重要性，但没有接着阐述听众不同应该怎样做，而且它出现了文中没有的内容：利用听众。B选项是该段最后举例说明的内容，if you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses。但这只是用来论证“听众不同问题不同”这个论点的一个具体个案，缺乏普遍性，无法由此而得出取笑他们就总会使幽默起作用的结论，因此不能选。D选项就是该段第二句谈到的in sympathy with their point of view，但是它仅仅是“对不同的人谈不同的问题”这个中心论点的部分解释，不具备完整性和概括性。

答题技巧：本题要求考生透过字里行间去把握段落主题句。注意主题句一般是观点而非描写、说明或事实。段落中除了表观点的主题句外，其他的内容一般起说明或论证作用，并且，主题句大都具有归纳性、概括性、抽象性等特点。


 

**42.[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

本题考查考生概括理解具体例子的能力，考生关键要把握作者通过举例手法所表达的观点。作者在第二段讲述了一则嘲笑医生的笑话。笑话中上帝的动作rush to grab 和stomp over都表明了上帝的傲慢和目中无人，而圣彼德的话“但是有时他认为自己是一名医生”表明医生也有同样的特点，即无礼、傲慢、自以为像上帝一样。由此可知，B选项为正确答案。

A选项不是笑话中暗示的医生的普遍特点，我们无法从笑话中得出医生对所有新来的人都不礼貌。而C选项和D选项都没有嘲笑他们的意味，因此也不对。


 

**43.[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

本题要求考生根据第三段的内容去推测最后一句的含义。文章第三段指出，如果谈话者是听话者中的一分子，就可以用双方共同的经历作为幽默的素材，否则，这样做就不合适。最后指出，这时如果拿公共服务行业作为替罪羊（scapegoats）去评论，你就会处于安全境地。这就说明即使对不同的听众也可以以它们为笑料，也就是说它们是大家经常谈论的笑料。因此D选项为正确答案。C 选项恰与原文意思相悖。A 选项未提到，因为当作笑料并非就是带来利益。B选项似乎也有道理，但是他的针对性不如D选项。


 

**44.[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**段落主旨题**。

本题要求考生理解第四段的主题思想。文章第四段指出，如果在讲述幽默时感到有些不自然，就必须加以练习，使之变得更自然。你可以加入一些随便的、看上去是即兴（off-the-cuff）的话，用轻松的、自然的方式把它说出来。让听众发笑的通常是讲述幽默的过程，因此应该放慢语速，再加上一些表情，这些都在告诉人们你在讲述笑话。从该段的一些关键词natural，relaxed，unforced和light-hearted等，都可看出D选项才是讲幽默故事的正确方法。

A选项是文中未出现的内容；B选项与文章内容相悖；C选项是在第五段中谈到搜集幽默素材时应该留意的内容之一，只是列举，同样不具有概括性，因而不能入选。


 

**45.[****答案]** A

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**文章主旨题**。

本题考的是对全文的理解，是总括题，要求考生综合各段主题找出全文的主旨。文章第一至三段谈的是选择恰当的幽默话题，以求实现幽默效果；第四段谈论的是自然随意的幽默，可以达到幽默效果；第五段建议人们留意幽默，并指出了幽默可能存在的地方，也就是实现幽默的一些策略方法。因此可知，A选项是全文都在谈论的论点，为正确的答案。

B选项不符合文章的主要内容，因为文中并未举出幽默有哪些种类。C选项也不是全文探讨的问题。D选项只是最后一段间接涉及的一些内容，如：对一句常言进行歪曲，玩弄语言文字或情景，夸大其词或是故意地轻描淡写等以求实现幽默的效果，因此无法概括全篇。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

① Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point if view.

本句主干是Your humor must be...and should help to show...，不定式to show后是两个that 引导的宾语从句：that you are one of the them以及that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point of view，中间用or连接。

② Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’convention, of a story which works well because the audience all shared the same view of doctors.

该句的主干是：Here is an example of a story，example 后是非限定性定语从句which I heard...做定语；story 后是限制性定语从句which works well做定语，其中又含有一个原因状语从句because...。work意思是“起作用，有效”。如：How long does a sleeping pill take to work? 安眠药要多长时间才起作用？

③ If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common to all of you **and** it’ll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties.

该句子有多重结构。第一重是，句首if引导的条件从句和主句构成主从复合句。if从句充当主句的条件状语，主句由两个并列的分句构成：you will be...and it’ll be appropriate....。第二重是，if从句中的group后接有一个限定性定语从句which you are addressing做定语，主句中前一个分句中不定式的宾语the experiences and problems 后接which 引导的定语从句做定语，后一分句的结构是it’ll be appropriate for sb. to do sth....。

be in a position to do sth.意思是“由于客观或主观条件”可能做某事。如：He is in a position to marry.他有条件结婚。passing 意思是：粗略的，随便的，仓促的。如：a passing mention 顺便提及。

④ With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman.

句中as 引导的是原因状语从句，will在这里是情态动词，表示某种推测。cut in with sth.意思是“以……插入”。

佳句赏析：

① Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different.

这就是我们常说的“因人而异”的英文版说法。

② If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.

两个if条件从句的并列、talking to和addressing、refer to和comment on的替换以及disorganized的重复，使该句子变化中有重复，动中有静。

 

**四、全文翻译**

如果你想在谈话中用幽默来使人发笑，你就必须知道如何识别共同的经历和共同的问题。**你的幽默必须与听众有关，向他们表明你是他们中的一员，或者你了解他们的处境并同情他们的观点**。（长难句①）**根据谈话对象的不同，问题也有所不同。**（佳句①）**如果你在和一群经理谈话，你就可以评论他们秘书紊乱的工作方法；相反，如果你在和一群秘书谈话，你就可以评论他们毫无章法的老板。**（佳句②）

**下面举一个例子，它是我在一个护士大会上听到的。这个故事效果很好，因为听众对医生都有同样的看法。**（长难句②）一个人到了天堂，由圣彼得带着他参观。他看到了豪华的住宅、美丽的花园、晴朗的天气等等。所有人都很安静、礼貌和友善，然而当这位新来的人在排队等候午餐时，突然被一位穿白大褂的人推到一旁。只见这人挤到了队伍的前头，抓起他的食物，噔噔地旁若无人地走到一张餐桌旁。“这是谁啊?”新来的人问圣彼得,“哦，那是上帝，”他回答说，“但有时也认为自己是一名医生。”

**如果你是你谈话对象集体中的一员，你就有条件去了解你们所共有的经历和问题，你就可对餐厅极难吃的食物或者总裁在选择领带方面差劲的品味进行评头论足。**（长难句③）**而对于其他听众，你就不能试图贸然地讲这种幽默，因为他们也许不喜欢外人对他们的餐厅或总裁有如此微词。**（长难句④）但如果你选择去评论邮局或电话局这样的替罪羊，那你就会很安全。

如果你在幽默时感到很别扭，你应该进行练习使它变得更自然。包括一些很随便的、看上去是即兴的话，你可以用轻松的、不做作的方式把它们说出来。常常是你说话的方式使听众发笑，因此说慢一些，并且记住扬扬眉毛或者做出一种不相信的表情都会向人们显示你正在说笑话。

留意幽默，它常常是在出其不意的时候出现。它可以是一句常言的歪曲如“你要是一开始不成功，就放弃”，或者是调侃词藻和场景；寻求夸大其词和轻描淡写；考虑一下你的谈话，选出一些词汇和句子，对它们反复琢磨，并注入一些幽默。

 

**Text 2**

**一、文章结构总体分析**

本文是一篇关于机器人科技发展的文章。文章首先介绍机器人科技发展取得的成果，接着谈到它的局限性，即机器人和人类在智能上的差距。

第一、二段：指出自从人类开始有了创造力，就一直在设计日益巧妙的工具去处理那些危险的、困难的工作，其结果是机器充斥了人类的生活并节省了许多劳动力。

第三至五段：指出机器人如果要进入节省劳力的下一个阶段，它必须能够独立地解决问题，但是这是一个艰巨的任务。目前研究人员已经将机器人模仿人脑活动的预想向后推迟了数十年，甚至数百年，因为人脑在迅速变化的环境中的高聚焦能力是机器人无法做到的。

 

**二、试题具体解析**

**46.****［答案］C**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

本题是个局部题，考查考生是否看懂了第一段。题干中的initially与原文的the dawn对应。该段第一句指出“自从人类开始有了创造力，就一直在设计日益巧妙的工具来处理一些危险、乏味、繁重或者是讨厌的工作”。C选项是对此句的恰当改写：the invention of tools与devised ever more cunning tools对应，for difficult and dangerous work与to cope with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty对应，因此它是正确答案。A选项是文章中没有的内容，其中的干扰词science fiction 只在第一段末尾提到，“如果说科学家还没有创造出机械版的科幻小说，他们也已经接近这个目标了”，这里只是通过打比方来形容科学家创造的机器工具越来越灵巧，和科幻小说一样神奇。B选项是智慧的表现，但却不是人类智慧的最初表现。D选项谈的是文中没有的“精英人物”。

**47.****［答案］C**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**词义题**。

本题考查学生从上下文猜测词义的能力。文章第二段第一句指出“现代世界充斥着越来越多聪明的gizmos，虽然我们几乎都注意不到他们，但他们的普遍存在却节省了许多人类劳力”，由此可知gizmos的特点是：普遍存在和节省劳力。下文提到的“工厂的机器人”、“银行的自动柜员机”、“地铁的机器人司机”、“医院做手术的机器人系统”对“gizmos”进一步举例说明，由此可猜出gizmos指的是“机器、设备或装置”，C选项正确。其他三个选项都不在本文讨论的对象范围之内。

**48.****［答案］D**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

文章第三段首句指出“机器人若要进入节省劳力的下一个阶段，它们必须能够在更少的人工监控下运行，并且至少能够自己做些决定，这样的目标为我们提出了一个真正的挑战”；接着在第二句里作者谈到此项挑战之所以艰巨的原因是：“尽管我们知道如何让机器人处理一个具体的错误，但是我们不能给它们足够的‘常识’使其与不断变化的世界进行可靠的交流”。由此可知，机器人目前还必须在人的操控下工作，它还不能独立适应不断变化的外部环境。D选项是对原句‘common sense’to reliably interact with a dynamic world的改写，为正确答案。

A和B选项均在第二段提及（医院做手术的机器人和自动取款机），可见这样的机器人是人能够造出来的。C选项不正确，因为第三段指出的“但是我们不能给他们足够的‘常识’去与动态世界进行可靠的交流”说明目前的机器人还是有一点点常识的。

**49.****［答案］B**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

文章第三段（翻译见上一题）说明当前阶段机器人只能在较多的人工监控下运行，可以处理具体的错误但不能独立地做决定，因此只有B选项的内容是机器人可以做的，排除A选项。文章提到工厂的机器人是用于节省人类劳动力，而不是改善环境的，排除C选项；D选项本末倒置，应该是人类创造力推动了机器人的发明。

**50.****［答案］C**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**作者意图题**。

本题表面上是考查例证写作的意图，实际上却考查了对文章最后一段的理解。该段的主题句是首句：研究人员发现，人类大脑中的近一千亿个神经细胞要比以前想象的更聪明，人类的感觉器官也更复杂。接下来作者通过对机器人和人脑的比较来说明段落主题，“机器人能够在人工控制的工厂环境下识别机器控制面板上不到一毫米的误差；但是人脑扫一眼一个快速变化的场景，就能迅速排除98%的不相干信息，立即把注意力集中到婉蜒的森林小路边的一只猴子，或者一大群人中的一张可疑的面孔上”。该段末句既对前面比较论证部分的目的进行说明，又重申了主题：世界上最先进的机器人也无法和人脑相比。可见文中举猴子的例子只是为了说明人脑的复杂性。四个选项中只有C选项说明机器人不如人脑，符合题意。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

① And if scientists have yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.

该句子是含if条件从句的主从复合句。注意其中词汇的用法。从句中have yet to表否定，意为“尚未，还不得不”；the mechanical version of science fiction是“机械版的科幻小说”，也就是指科幻小说中的梦想在机器人上的实现；主句中的come close是“走近”，而不是come to a close（结束，完成）。

② As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor.

该句子的主干是the modern world is populated by intelligent gizmos，宾语gizmos后是两个whose引导的定语从句做定语：whose presence…but whose universal existence…。

③ And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics, there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy—far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.

该句的主干是there are robot systems，systems后是that引导的定语从句，破折号后面的部分用来补充说明submillimeter accuracy。句首介词短语thanks to（由于，多亏…）引导原因状语。 

④ But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves—goals that pose a real challenge.

该句子是含if条件从句的主从复合句，句首but表示对上一段内容的转折。主句的主干是they will have to operate...and be able to make decisions...。破折号后是一个补充说明成分，修饰整个主句，其中goals指的是前面主句的两个并列谓语动作，后面还有that引导的定语从句。If从句中be to do结构表示一种愿望，可译为“要想…”，又如：If you are to succeed you must be patient and persistent.（要想成功，就必须有耐心，有毅力），这种结构还可以表示安排（They are to marry next week.）、命令（You are to be back by 10 o’clock.）、禁止（Children are not to smoke.）等。

⑤ Despite a spell of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.

该句子的特点是状语修饰成分较长。从despite开始一直到2010都是句子的让步状语，意为“尽管…”，其中含有关系副词when引导的定语从句限定时间名词the 1960s and 1970s。句子的主干是researchers have begun to extend that forecast。a spell of意思是“一段时间”，It appeared that意思是“似乎，好像”，如:It appears that you have known the news.（你好像已经知道这个消息了）。

⑥ What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented—and human perception far more complicated—than previously imagined.

该句中的特点是插入语的使用。句子主干是What they found is that...，主语和be动词间的插入成分是介词in+现在分词结构做状语。be动词后是that引导的表语从句，该从句其实是两个句子的糅合，即nerve cells are much more talented than previously imagined和human perception is far more complicated than previously imagined，句子通过破折号的方式把两个句子共同的部分省略掉了。

⑦ But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a big crowd.

该句子关键要把握其结构上对几个动词的处理：the human mind can glimpse...and disregard..., focusing on…or…”，前两个动词由and连接，做主句的谓语，第三个动词focus on变为分词结构做结果状语。glimpse接的宾语是由定语从句修饰的中心名词98 percent，focus on接的宾语是由连词or连接的两个并列成分：the monkey *or* the single suspicious face。 

佳句赏析：

Our factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robo-drivers.

排比句的运用通过罗列反映出我们现在的生活里到处都有机器人的影子。拟人手法的使用赋予了机器人很多人的特质，生动地表现出他们和人的相似性，如：robot arms，automated teller terminals thank us with politeness，tireless robo-drivers。

 

**四、全文翻译**

自从人类开始有了创造力，就一直在设计日益巧妙的工具来处理那些危险、枯燥、繁重或者是讨厌的工作。这样一种驱动力导致了机器人学的诞生，即赋予机器以人的各种技能的科学。**如果说科学家还没有实现科幻小说中对机器的幻想，他们也已经很接近这个目标了**（长难句①）**。**

**由此引起的结果是，现代世界充斥着越来越多的智能仪器，虽然我们几乎都注意不到他们，但他们的普遍存在却节省了许多人类劳力**（长难句②）。**我们的工厂里轰鸣着机器人组装臂的节奏声；我们的银行业务完成于自动柜员机旁，完成业务后，它们还会用机器语言礼貌地感谢我们；我们的地铁车由不知疲倦的机器人司机驾驶。**（佳句①）**由于电子器件和微型机械仪器的不断缩小，现在已出现了机器人系统能够进行精确到毫米的脑部和骨髓手术，其精确性远远超过熟练的医生仅用他们的双手所达到的水平**（长难句③）**。**

**但是要想让机器人进入节省劳力的下一个阶段，它们必须能够在更少的人工监控下运行，并且至少能够独立地作一些决定。这些是真正具有挑战性的目标**。（长难句④）“虽然我们知道如何让机器人去处理一个特定的错误，”NASA的一个机器人项目经理戴维·拉维里说，“但是我们不能给它们足够的‘常识’使其与不断变化的世界进行可靠的交流”。

实际上对真正的人工智能的探索己经取得了各种不同的成果。**虽然在20世纪60年代和70年代有过一段乐观的时期——那时侯仿佛晶体管电路和微处理器的发展使人们相信它们在2010年能够复制人类大脑的活动——但是最近研究人员己经开始将这个预测延后数十年，甚至数百年**（长难句⑤）**。**

**在试图建造思维模型的过程中，研究人员发现，人类大脑中的近一千亿个神经细胞要比以前想象的更聪明，人类的感觉器官也更复杂**（长难句⑥）。他们建造的机器人在严格控制的工厂环境里，能够在机器控制面板上识别毫米以下的误差。**但是人脑扫一眼一个快速变化的场景，就能迅速排除98%的不相干信息，立即聚焦于婉蜒的森林小路边的一只猴子，或者一大群人中的一张可疑的面孔上**（长难句⑦）**。**世界上最先进的计算机系统也不达不到这种能力。神经学科学家至今仍然不知道我们人类是怎样做到这一点的。

 

**Text 3**

**一、文章结构总体分析**

这是一篇关于油价上涨对全球经济影响的文章。文章主要分析了油价上涨不会造成全球经济衰退的原因。文章前两段为引子（引起读者的兴趣并交待背景），第三段给出作者观点，紧接着用三个理由对其观点加以支持。

第一段：以提问和数据两种方式提出作者关注的问题：这次石油价格上涨会不会像前两次一样造成经济衰退？以便引起读者的兴趣。

第二段：补充说明油价上涨的另外两个因素，交代所讨论问题的背景。

第三段：第一句话为全文的中心思想，也是对第一段提出问题的回答，即：不会导致经济滑坡，接着给出一个理由——原油仅占汽油价格的一小部分。

第四段：给出支持作者论点的第二个理由：大国经济对石油的依赖性不大。本段主要使用数据进行论证。

第五段：不会导致经济滑坡的第三个理由：没有整体的物价上涨为大背景。论证中使用70年代的情况作为参照与现在的情况进行比较。

 

**二、试题具体解析**


 

**51.[****答案] B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

第一段明确指出“自从石油输出国组织在3月决定减少原油供应以来，原油的价格便从去年12月的不到10美元一桶上升至约26美元一桶”，因此B选项为正确答案。

A选项是第一段提到的前两次油价暴涨造成的后果，而非原因。 C选项和D选项是第二段提到的进一步推动油价上涨的原因，而非主要原因。

答题技巧：题干中如果有找出主要原因之类的提法，说明原文中肯定有不止一个原因，命题意图是检查考生能否从众多信息中抓住主要信息。


 

**52.[****答案] D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

文章第三段指出，原油价格只占汽油零售价格的一小部分，其大部分(在欧洲高达五分之四)是税收，因此原油价格的变动对汽油价格影响不大。由此可知，影响汽油价格的主要因素是税收。D选项为正确答案，而不是A选项。B选项是前两次石油涨价产生的结果（第1段第4句）；而C选项文中未提及。

答题技巧：命题目的是检查考生能否通过文章所给事实推出二者的潜在关系。对于此题，需要考生准确把握price的具体所指，方能正确解题。


 

**53.[****答案] D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

根据“rich countries”可断定答案大抵在第四段，原文为“Rich economies”。文中提到，“国际经合组织在最近一期的《经济展望》中估计，如果油价持续一年维持在每桶22美元左右，与1998年的13美元一桶相比，也只会使发达国家的石油进口在支出增加GDP的0.25%～0.5%”。这个数据表明影响不是很大，因此D选项为正确答案。

B选项和C选项文中没有提及，A选项和题干不能构成因果关系。


 

**54.[****答案] A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

文章一开始提出最近石油价格大幅上涨，接下来阐述这次油价上涨不会造成经济衰退的原因：（1）原油价格只占汽油价格的一小部分；（2）发达国家对石油的依赖性不如从前；（3）此次油价上涨并不在商品总价格上涨和全球需求旺盛这种大环境中发生。因此，综合全文得出的结论是A选项。

B选项与文中通货膨胀是石油危机的结果相悖（第1段第4句）。C选项（第4段第2句）和D选项（第4段最后一句）都是文中的事实细节，并非综合全文而得到的结论。


 

**55.[****答案] A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者态度题**。

作者大篇幅地给出理由说明这次油价上涨的后果不会很严重。第三段谈到，“我们有充分的理由预期这次油价暴涨给经济带来的影响不会像20世纪70年代那么严重”，最后一段第一句话又谈到“另一个不应该因为油价上升而失眠的原因是，与20世纪70年代不同，这次油价上升不是发生在普遍的物价暴涨及全球需求过旺背景之下”。可见A选项表达了作者的真正态度。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

① This near tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979～1980, when they also almost tripled.

句子主干是This near tripling of oil prices ...calls up... memories of the 1973 ... and 1979～1980 ...其中of oil prices 修饰前面的tripling ，of the 1973和1979～1980修饰memories。1973以及1979～1980后面又分别跟了两个when引导的定语从句对时间进行修饰。

② Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the short term. 

该句主语Strengthening economic growth和谓语could push之间放入一个时间状语作插入成分，用逗号与主句隔开。

③ The OECD estimates in its latest *Economic Outlook* that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25%～0.5% of GDP.

句子主干是The OECD estimates ...that ...，that后是宾语从句，在这个从句中又含有一个if引导的条件状语，主语是this，指的就是这个条件句，谓语是would increase…，compared with $13 in 1998是一个状语。

④On the other hand, oil importing emerging economies—to which heavy industry has shifted—have become more energy intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed.

句子主干是oil importing emerging economies ...have become ...and so could be ...；其中在主语和第一个谓语后放入一个which引导的定语从句修饰主语作插入成分。

⑤One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it has not occurred against the background of general commodity price inflation and global excess demand.

句子主干是... reason ... is that ...。not to lose sleep over …是reason的后置定语。that 引导的表语从句比较复杂，其中包括一个形容词短语unlike…做状语，主语it指的是前文提到的the rise in oil prices。

知识点补充：lose sleep over意思是“因…而失眠”；occurred against the background of ... 意思是“发生在…的背景下”。

佳句赏析：

So where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?

句中的gloom and doom用了尾韵的修辞方法，很有节奏感。

 

**四、全文翻译**

过去经济衰落的坏日子是否会重来？自从石油输出国组织在3月决定减少原油供应以来，原油的价格便从去年12月的不到10美元一桶上升到到约26美元一桶。**这次近三倍的涨价令人想起了1973年和1979-1980年两次可怕的石油恐慌，当时的油价分别是涨了四倍和近三倍**。（长难句①）前两次的油价暴涨都导致了两位数的通货膨胀率以及全球性的经济衰退。**那么这次警告人们厄运来临的头版新闻都到哪里去了呢？**（佳句①）

本周伊拉克暂停石油出口，这使油价又一次上扬。**强劲的经济增长势头，随着北半球冬季的到来，有可能在短期内使石油价格涨得更高。**（长难句②）

然而，我们有充分的理由预期这次油价暴涨给经济带来的影响不会象20世纪70年代那么严重。与70年代相比，现在多数国家的原油价格占汽油价格的分额要小。在欧洲，税金在汽油零售价的比例高达五分之四，因此，即使原油价格发生很大的波动，汽油价格所受的影响也不会象过去那么显著。 

发达国家对石油的依赖性也不如从前，因此对油价的波动也就不会那么敏感。能源储备、燃料替代以及能源密集型重工业的重要性降低，这些都减少了石油消耗量。软件、咨询及移动通讯消耗的石油，比钢铁、汽车行业少得多。发达国家国内生产总值（以目前价格计算）中，每一个美元所消耗的石油量比1973年少了近一半。**国际经合组织在最近一期的《经济展望》中估计，如果油价持续一年维持在22美元左右，与1998年的13美元一桶相比，这也只会使发达国家的石油进口支出上增加GDP的0.25—0.5个百分点。**（长难句③）这还不到1974年或1980年收入减少部分的四分之一。**另一方面，进口石油的新兴国家由于转向了重工业，消耗能量更大，因此可能会受到石油危机的强烈影响。**（长难句④）

**另外一个不应因油价上升而失眠的原因是，与20世纪70年代不同，这次油价上升不是发生在普遍的物价暴涨及全球需求过旺背景之下。**（长难句⑤）世界上很多地区才刚刚走出经济衰落。《经济学家》的商品价格指数与一年前相比，总体上没有什么变化。1973年的商品价格跃升了70%，而1979年也上升了近30%。

**一、文章结构总体分析**

本文讲述的是美国法律和医学界对于医生协助病人结束生命这一医疗措施的支持态度。这篇文章理解起来的困难在于段落数量较多以及意群分散，有时同一意群的内容分为两段论述。

第一、二段：从语意上讲实际是一个段落，第一段只有一句话，指出最高法院的裁决对医生协助病人结束生命这一现象的重要性，第二段推理证明为什么重要。

第三段：首先指出医生协助病人结束生命这一现象并不是新鲜事物，进而引用南希•杜勒尔的话说明最高法院的裁决产生的影响在于保护医生。

第四段：依然使用引证的方法说明第三段“保护医生”的论点。

第五、六段：从语意上讲又是一个段落，第五段是主题句，说明该裁决的另一个推动因素，即，病人不愿忍受死亡的折磨。第六段使用典型事例对此进行论证。

第七段：第一句为主题句，说明对此医学界采取的行动。

第八段：采用引证法说明律师可以起关键作用。

 

**二、试题具体解析**


 

**56.[****答案]** B

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

这是一道总括性的题，需要以文章中的多处信息为线索。选项B是文章第二段首句的改写。该句提到，法院在判决中承认医生协助病人结束生命不是宪法赋予的权利。选项中的“illegal”对应文中“no constitutional right”，“doctors to help the dying end their lives”对应“physician-assisted suicide”。

选项A的时间与原文不符。“used to do”意为“过去常常做……事情（但是现在不做了）”，而文章第三段提到，近年来医生一直使用这个原则为他们使用大剂量的吗啡去控制临死病人（terminally ill patients）的痛苦进行辩护。选项C与原文意思相反。第二段首句明确提出，法院实际上对这种“双重效果”的医疗原则表示了支持（in effect supported the medical principle）。选项D在文中未提及，原文只提到医生没有宪法赋予的权利去协助病人结束生命。

答题技巧：这种跨段落的细节题，正确选项一般是对原文中某语句的改写或替换，错误选项则与原文意义相悖或无关。


 

**57.[****答案]** **C**     

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

本题也是总括性的题目，信息比较分散。文章第二段和第三段分别提到：法院对“双重效果”的医疗原则表示支持，而近年来医生一直使用这个原则为他们使用大剂量吗啡进行辩护。按照逻辑推理，法院支持原则，医生利用原则做某事，那么法院应该支持这件事。因此，选项C为正确答案。

选项A与原文意思相反。“hold sb.(to be) a/n.”意为“认为、相信某人怎样”，如：I hold the parents responsible for their children’s behavior. 第五段谈到，外科手术中，医生虽然冒了病人死亡的风险，但是我们不把这种情况下的死亡称作他杀，因为医生并非有意要杀死病人，即医生没有责任。选项B与原文不符。第六段提到，引起病人绝望的原因恰恰是现代医学一直只能延长他们死亡前的肉体痛苦。选项D与原文意思相反。第五段中健康法律系主任通过外科手术的例子说明，意图是决定医生所开的药物合不合法的关键，其含义是只要意图是好的，即使出现坏的结果也是可以接受的。


 

**58.[****答案]** **B** 

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

根据关键字“NAS报告”和“临终关怀”定位第七段。全国科学院发布的报告中明确提到了临终关怀的两个问题：（1）undertreatment of pain（对病痛不进行足够的处理）；(2) the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures”（大胆使用“无效和强制的医疗程序去延长死亡期甚至让病人死得很没有尊严）”。因此选项B是提到的问题之一。A和D选项是干扰项，A选项中的prolonged、medical procedures是原文中出现的词汇，D选项中的insufficient和undertreatment近义，但它们都只是词语的重新组合，含义上和原文有出入。Ｃ项中的“systematic”意为“planned in advance and done with malicious thoroughness and exactness”(有预谋的、蓄意的)。如：a systematic attempt to ruin one’s reputation (蓄意破坏某人的名誉)。


 

\59. **[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]**本题考核的知识点是：**词义题**。

原文谈到的是一种使用“无效和强制的医疗程序去延长死亡期甚至让病人死得很没有尊严”的做法，考生需判断哪个形容词可以替代aggressive来描述这种行为。“aggressive”这个词用于褒义时，意为“强有力的、坚持己见的”，用于贬义时，意为“攻击性的、不顾后果的”。选项A“Bold”用于贬义时意为“大胆的、冒失的、失慎的”，意义最接近。

知识点补充：介词of可用于两个名词（短语）之间，前者形容后者，如：He’s got the devil of temper(devil形容temper)；Where’s that fool of a receptionist？（fool 形容receptionist）。同样，这里的aggressive use 用来形容ineffectual and forced medical procedures。

**60.[****答案]** **D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

在最后一段中安纳斯明确指出，painful deaths(病人痛苦的死亡)should result in license suspension(应该使那些对此漠不关心的医生受到惩罚，吊销执照)，因此选项D“延长病人不必要的痛苦”是医生受制裁的原因。

选项A太泛，不一定是指的是无视病人痛苦这一方面。文章第五段提到，安纳斯认为只要医生开的药物是用于合法的医疗目的，就没有违法，而不存在药量多少的问题。因此，可以排除选项B和C。

 

**三、文章长难句分析和佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

①Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect,” a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects—a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen—is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

这是个一句话的段落，其中心结构是the Court supported the medical principle，Although引导的分句与后面构成转折关系。a centuries-old moral principle...good effect是对the medical principle of “double effect”进行解释说明的同位语，其主干是principle holding that an action... is permissible。

②Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death.” 

该句的基本结构是Nancy Dubler contends that the principle will shield doctors，who引导的定语从句修饰doctors。注意insist后面有接虚拟语气和非虚拟语气两种用法。前者意为“坚持要求、坚持认为”，如：I insisted that you (should) take immediate action to put this right，后者意为“坚持说、固执声称”，如：She insisted that she was innocent.这里应该取第二种意思。

另外在新闻报道体裁的文章中引用某专家的言论，多采用这种句式结构，即人名+职位+动词（contend, maintain，hold，believe等）+that引导的宾语从句。本文在第四段和第五段就两次出现。

③It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying” as the twin problems of end-of-life care.

该句子的主干是It identifies... as ...，identify接的宾语是由and连接的两个of短语：undertreatment of pain和aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures，其中第二个of的宾语后紧跟着一个定语从句做定语。

④“Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering,” to the extent that it constitutes “systematic patient abuse”.

该句的主干是physicians seem unconcerned with the pain... to the extent that...，pain后面由一个省略了关系代词的定语从句修饰，needlessly and predictably意为“既没有必要又不可避免”。extend后也接了一个that引导的定语从句。

佳句赏析：

①On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying.

On another level是全文的分界点，起着切换话题的作用。fueled in part by运用暗喻的修辞手法，形象地描述了后面的现象对这场争论起到推波助澜的作用。

②The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospices, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.

该句将四个to引导的不定式结构并列，使句式显得整齐而具有气势。

 

**四、全文翻译**

最高法庭关于医生协助病人自杀问题的裁决，对于医学界寻求减轻病危者的痛苦，具有重要的意义。

**尽管裁决认为，宪法没有赋予医生帮助病人自杀的权利，然而最高法庭实际上却认可了 “双效”的医疗原则，这个存在了好几个世纪的道德原则认为，如果某种行为具有双重效果（希望达到的好效果和可以预见得到的坏效果），那么，只要行为实施的目的是想达到好效果，这个行为就是可以被允许的。**（长难句①）

近年来，医生们一直在借用这项原则，为自己替病危患者注射大剂量的吗啡镇痛的做法提供正当的理由，尽管他们知道，不断增加的剂量最终会杀死病人。

**蒙特非奥里医疗中心主任南希·道布勒认为，这项原则将保护一些医生，他们直到现在还坚持说，在大量药物可能加速病人死亡的情况下，他们总不能给病人开足够的药来帮助他们止痛。**（长难句②）

波士顿大学健康法律系主任乔治·安纳斯坚持认为，只要医生是出于合理的医疗目的开药，那么即使此药会加速病人的死亡，医生的行为也没有违法。“这就像做手术，”他说，“尽管医生冒着病人死亡的危险，我们也不能称那些死亡为谋杀，因为医生并没有想杀死病人。假定你是一名医生，只要你的目的不是让病人自杀，你就可以去冒你病人自杀的风险。”

**另一方面，许多医疗界人士承认，致使医助自杀这场争论升温的部分原因是由于病人们的绝望情绪，对这些病人来说，现代医学延长了临终前肉体的痛苦。**(佳句①)

就在最高法庭对医助自杀进行裁决的前三周，全国科学学会公布了一份长达两卷的报告《临近死亡：完善临终护理》。**报告确定了医院临终关怀护理中存在的两个问题：对病痛处理不力和大胆使用“无效而强制性的医疗程序”，这些程序可能会延长死亡期，甚至会让病人临终时痛苦不堪。**（长难句③）

**医疗行业正在采取措施，让年轻医生去晚期病人休养所培训，测试各种大胆的镇痛疗法方面的知识，为医院护理制定一份医疗保障制度的条例，以及制定新的标准来评估和治疗病人的临终痛苦。**（佳句②）

安纳斯说，在坚持让善意的医疗动机转化成更好的护理方面，律师可以发挥关键作用。**“不少医生对病人不必遭受的、可预见的痛苦无动于衷”，甚至构成“蓄意虐待病人”。**（长难句④）他说，行医执照颁发机构“必须明确表明——病人痛苦地死亡可以被认为是由于医生治疗不当造成的，应当吊销其行医执照”。

 

**Part B** 

一、试题总体分析

本文主要讲的是行为科学的建立。人类的行为问题只能由行为科学去解决，然而行为科学发展缓慢，部分原因是传统意义上的行为科学多数情况下还是从心态等方面而不是从环境中寻找行为的根源，环境的重要作用刚刚被承认并开始成为研究对象，而传统理解又根深蒂固，只有当这些问题得以解决之后，行为科学才能得以发展。

与往年相同，本年度的翻译试题首先要求考生进行语法分析，梳理句子结构。2002年试题的句子结构并不十分复杂，但是翻译时需要小心谨慎，因为里面有一些词汇的意思不是考生在词汇表中记忆的词义，而需要根据上下文，做出相应的调整，才能确定在本上下文中搭配恰当的词义，如果仅停留在英汉词义对译的层面上，译出的句子肯定比较生硬蹩脚，有时甚至不知所云。通过对考生试卷的抽查，发现部分考生对词汇的掌握仅停留在英汉词义对译的层次；语法分析能力差，句子结构梳理不清；有些英文句子理解到了，但由于中文表达能力非常有限，结果翻译出来的句子逻辑混乱，自然得分很低。因此，考生如果要想翻译得高分，应培养好扎实的语言（中、英文）基本功。

 

二、试题具体解析

（41）One difficulty is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of character, human nature, and so on.

   **[****解析]**  本题考核的知识点是：**词义选择、固定搭配trace … to …、表语从句**。

这是一个简单句，主干为：One difficulty is that …。that引导的表语从句中主语all由一个of引导名词性从句 what is called behavioral science 修饰；谓语是continues；最后的states of mind, feelings...and so on 都是做trace…to…中介词to的宾语。

词汇：what is called behavioral science在句中不能译为“被称为行为的科学”；continue to原意为“继续…”，但是此处译成“继续”不特别贴切，在这里的意思其实是“仍然，依然”，动词应译成副词；trace 做动词，trace sth.（back）to sth.的意思是find the origin of sth.“找到…的根源”为固定搭配。state of mind 意为“心态”；trait意为“特征”；human nature 意为“人性”。

译文：难题之一在于所谓的行为科学几乎全都依然从心态、情感、性格特征、人性等方面去寻找行为的根源。

（42）The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly because the explanatory items often seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds of explanations have been hard to find.

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**形容词带不定式、对仗结构、被动语态的译法**。

这是一个主从复合句，句子主干为The behavioral sciences have been slow to … partly because… and partly because …。slow to change是形容词带不定式，译成“发展缓慢”。主句是由两个partly because形成对仗结构，都引导原因状语从句，可译作“部分原因是……”，“部分由于……”。两个状语从句都是被动语态，但都可译成主动语态。两个从句内容相互对照，可以对照理解：other kinds of explanations（其他的解释）是相对于前一从句中的the explanatory items（用来解释的依据）说的；directly observed （直接观察到）和hard to find（难以找到）意思上也基本相对。

词汇：the explanatory items直译是“解释性的项目”，但在这是指“解释行为的项目”，应该根据上下文需要补上“行为”这一层意思。

译文：行为科学之所以发展缓慢，部分原因是用来解释行为的依据似乎往往是直接观察到的，部分原因是其他的解释方式一直难以找到。

（43）The role of natural selection in evolution was formulated only a little more than a hundred years ago, and the selective role of the environment in shaping and maintaining the behavior of the individual is only beginning to be recognized and studied.

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**词义的引申、被动语态的译法**。

这个句子是由and 连接的两个简单句构成的。前一个句子为被动语态，其主干是the role … was formulated…。the role由of...和in...两个介词短语修饰，only a little...ago是时间状语，汉语中状语的位置是主句之前或谓语动词之前。后一个句子主干为the selective role of … in … is only beginning to be …。主语role由形容词selective和of the environment in...individual修饰，in...表示“在…方面”。两个分句都是被动语态，但被动语态不一定全要译成“被”，因为中文许多情况下主动态可以表示被动。此外还有“得以……”，“为……所”等方法可以选择。

词汇*：*role的一个意思是“角色”，这里使用的是另外一个词义“作用”，两个句子的主语的结构都是the role of A in B，of 和in都修饰the role，意思是“A在B方面的作用”。formulate 的意思是to create sth. in a precise form（阐明）；a little more than a hundred years意为“一百多年”；shape 做动词的意思是“塑造”。

译文：自然选择在进化中的作用仅在一百多年前才得以阐明，而环境在塑造和保持个体行为时的选择作用则刚刚开始被认识和研究。

（44）They are the possessions of the autonomous （self-governing）man of traditional theory, and they are essential to practices in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and given credit for his achievements.

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**代词指代、定语从句的译法**。

这是一个由and 连接的并列句。前一句中是主系表结构：They are the possessions of …；后一句也是主系表结构：they are essential to …。前一分句中考查主语指代问题，本题两个分句的主语都是they，它们的上文是：Freedom and dignity illustrate the difficulty。They是复数，因此可以推断它们不是指代difficulty，而是指代freedom和dignity。possessions意为“拥有的东西”，在这可转译成动词“拥有”。此处括号（self-governing）的作用是解释autonomous （自治的，自主的，自我管理的）这个词，两词意思基本一样，译时只用一个即可。

后一分句中，practices 由in which...achievements修饰。定语从句中是被动语态，主语是a person，谓语是is held...和 (is) given。按照汉语习惯，可以分别处理为：“一个人应该对自己的行为负责”和“一个人因…受到表扬、给予肯定”。

词汇： held不能翻译成“持、握”，它在这里是“认为”的意思。再如：Many people hold the opinion that the Government should take measures to stop terrorism.（许多人认为政府应当采取措施去制止恐怖主义），文中is held responsible for…可以意译为“要求一个人对……负责”；give credit for意为“因……而受到表扬”；practices的意思很多，如“练习，实践”等，在这里，它的意思是thing done regularly; habit or custom，即“习惯，做法”，在翻译中由于这些“做法”的具体内容的出现，“做法”这个词可以被省略。essential意为“对……必不可少”，即“是…的必要条件”，或“是…必不可少的前提”。

技巧：考研中经常考查代词指代，包括they，it，that，this等等。这些代词给理解造成了困难，是一个难点。其实这些代词基本上都不难在上下文中找到答案，它们基本上都指前文出现的某人或某物（this较为特殊，还可以指紧接的下文）。考生一般根据代词的单复数和题目的意思就可以找到指代对象。

译文：自由和尊严（它们）是传统理论定义的自主人拥有的，是要求一个人对自己的行为负责并因其业绩而给予肯定的必不可少的前提。

（45）Until these issues are resolved, a technology of behavior will continue to be rejected, and with it possibly the only way to solve our problems. 

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**省略句、正面意思反面表达、代词指代**。

本句是一个并列句，由and连接，前半句由于时间状语until提前，主句进行倒装。until意为“直到”，直译是“在这些问题得到解决之前，技术将继续……”，这种说法不符合中文习惯，它适合从反面表达：“如果这些问题得不到解决，技术将……”。注意被动语态are resolved按照汉语习惯可以译成“得到解决”。

and后是一省略句，其难点在于确定代词it的指代内容。it 经常指代前文的单数名词或不可数名词（词组），也经常指代前文的某件事情，某个情况。本文中就是最后一种用法，it指的就是前文a technology of behavior will continue to be rejected这件事情。

with做状语一般表示伴随。这一分句只有一个状语加一个名词结构，不成一个完整的句子。其实，省略句一般是与前句的相同成分才会被省略，前一句的谓语部分是：will continue to be rejected。所以后一分句补充完整是：with the rejection of the technology of behavior, the only way to solve our problem will continue to be rejected.。当然这里with it也可简单译为“随之”，但是只有真正了解句子之后才能正确翻译。

词汇：technology of behavior要根据文章内容适当加词，译为“研究行为的技术手段”。

译文：（如果）这些问题得不到解决，研究行为的技术手段就会继续受到排斥，解决问题的惟一方式可能也随之继续受到排斥。

 

**三、参考译文**

几乎我们所有的问题都涉及到人类行为，这些问题不能单纯依靠物理学和生物技术就得以解决。我们需要的是一门行为技术，但是发展行为技术需要科学为基础，在这方面，我们一直滞后。（41）**难题之一在于所谓的行为科学几乎全都依然从心态、情感、性格特征、人性等方面去寻找行为的根源**。物理学和生物学一度使用类似的方法，而且当它们放弃这些方法后才得以向前发展。（42）**行为科学之所以发展缓慢，部分原因是用来解释行为的依据似乎往往是直接观察到的，部分原因是其他的解释方式一直难以找到**。环境固然重要，但是它的作用依然不很清楚。环境并不起强迫或促进的作用，它进行的是选择，这种功能发现和分析起来都很困难。（43）**自然选择在进化中的作用仅在一百多年前才得以阐明，而环境在塑造和保持个体行为时的选择作用则刚刚开始被认识和研究**。然而，随着有机体和环境之间的相互作用逐渐为人们所了解，一度被认为是由思维、感情、性格产生的影响现在被追溯到人们可以理解的环境上去了，因而，建立行为技术也就成为了可能。然而，除非行为技术取代科学出现之前形成的传统观念，否则它无法解决我们的问题，而这些传统观念已经根深蒂固。自由和尊严就能说明困难程度。（44）**它们是传统理论定义的自主人拥有的，是要求一个人对自己的行为负责并因其业绩而给予肯定的必不可少的前提**。科学分析把中心从责任和成就转向了环境。这也引发了关于“价值”的问题。谁来使用这一技术，又要达到何种目的？

（45）**（如果）这些问题得不到解决，研究行为的技术手段就会继续受到排斥，解决问题的惟一方式可能也随之继续受到排斥。**

 

**Section IV Writing**

**一、审题谋篇**

  本题为图画，是命题加提纲式写作。

与往年的图画加提纲式写作相比，2002年考题给出了题目“Cultures—National and International”。对于考生这是不应忽略的审题重点之一。首先，由题目可看出，本文关键字为“文化”，修饰词为“National”和“International”再加上图片的标题是“An **American** Girl in Traditional **Chinese** Costume”，由此可以得出本文的立意应该是文化交流。这种交流反映了两方面的情况：一方面是中国文化对世界文化的渗透，中国源远流长的文化本身是世界文化财产的一部分，中国的腾飞无疑使中国文化这颗世界文化中的瑰宝更加耀眼。另一方面是世界对中国文化的了解与接受。瑰宝自然是吸引人的，世界人民渴望了解中国。由此，当外国人身着中式服装，体验中国文化时，那种欣喜与满意自然也在情理之中。

另外，事实上，考研的考题通常是有着某种社会意义的。2001年中国发生的几件大事确实使世界对中国刮目相看，如奥运申办成功，中国加入世界贸易组织等。这些确实加强了世界了解中国的渴望。加之中国经济腾飞，中国要走出去，外国要走进来，这种国际间的交流已成定局。有了以上想法，作文中心就已确定。

​    文章可以遵循大纲写成两段，也可以分为三段。第一段描写图画并指出图画所反映的现象，即：中国文化被许多外国人接受和认可。第二段主要对这一现象做出评论，可以集中于讨论这种现象产生的原因。在这一段中，可以用一些表示“导致、引起”意思的词汇，例如： “bring about, give rise to, cause, lead to, bring forth, make happen”等等。考生可以根据实际情况决定是否增加一个第三段，该段属于发挥，写法考生应该比较熟悉，既可以谈自己的看法，也可预测一下这种现象将来发展的趋势。

 

二、**参考范文**

Cultures—National and International

​    This unique picture shows an American girl in traditional Chinese costume. The **jeweled** headdress，**beaded** necklace and earrings with tassels，and silk attire with ribbons **characterize** the traditional costume of Chinese **minority nationality** girls. The costume adds **oriental** charm to her beauty. Her **radiant** smile is **as much a tribute to Chinese culture as to the progress** China has recently made. Like this American girl who shows a special interest in Chinese costumes, more and more foreigners have begun to understand and accept the Chinese culture.  

  Obviously，we can **deduce** from this picture that with the development of China，the increasing charm of Chinese tradition **appeals to** more and more foreigners who come to China. On the one hand，it **highlights** the glamour of our culture—now **universally** accepted as the **invaluable treasure** of all human beings. Attracted by the splendid Chinese culture，now **many a foreigner** **floods into** China to study or to work. On the other hand，it reflects our great achievements. When China was then **engulfed** in poverty，backwardness，corruption and foreign invasion，who **cared about** the culture **associated with** the pigtailed coolies? But during the last two decades one can hardly ignore the rapid progress of China. Three months after China won the right to **host** their first Olympics in 2008，China **capped** the most significant year in its sporting history when the national soccer team reached the World Cup finals for the first time. How can one resist being appealed to such an energetic country with a long and colorful culture!

**It goes without saying** that culture exchange **does good to** people in many ways. Firstly, it effectively reduces the misunderstanding between people from different cultures. Moreover, this kind exchange has **mutual** benefits to people from different cultures because it **enables** them to learn from each other. As a result, culture exchange has become more and more common in our life.

 

**三、范文点评**

文章结构：

从结构上看，范文首先对提纲做出适当调整，分为三段。每段段首出现主题句，点明该段主要思想，每段内部层次清晰。第一段段首为该段主题句，中间对图画进行描写，段尾从图画中得出全文的主题。第二段段首为该段主题句，进而用On the one hand 和On the other hand 分两个方面进行论证。第三段是进一步的发挥，段首提出作者观点，并在段尾对全文做出总结。

语言亮点：

\1. jeweled：“镶珠宝的”，与下面的beaded（珠子串成的）属于同一种用法，为名词加ed构成形容词。类似的用法还有：bearded有胡须的，haired有毛发的，windowed有窗的。

\2. characterize：“是…的特点；以…为特征”。例如：High GDP increase rate characterizes the overall economic development of China in the past ten years.（国内生产总值高增长率是过去十年中国整体经济发展的特点）。

\3. minority nationality：“少数民族”。

\4. oriental：“东方的”。例如：The Oriental Pearl Tower（东方明珠电视塔）；Shanghai is an oriental metropolis（上海是一个东方大都会）。

\5. radiant：“容光焕发的，喜气洋洋的”，例如：The bride was radiant (with joy). 她（因高兴）而精神焕发。

\6. as much a tribute to Chinese culture as to the progress：as much … as…“和…一样，如同…”。例如：Protecting the environment is as much the government’s responsibility as every citizen’s duty.（保护环境既是政府的职责，同样也是每个公民的责任）。tribute to意思为“对…的称赞”。

\7. deduce：推论，可替换的词语还有：conclude。

\8. appeal to：“向…上诉”或“吸引”。例如：Video games are increasingly appealing to teenagers.（电子游戏越来越吸引青少年）。

\10. universally：“普遍”。如：It is a universally accepted principle that …。

\11. invaluable treasure：“无价之宝”。例如：Health is an invaluable blessing.（健康是无价之宝）。

\12. many a foreigner：“很多外国人”。many a加名词单数相当于该名词的复数形式，是古英语的遗留痕迹。

\13. flood into：“涌入”。例如：Many migrant workers flood into cities.（很多农民工涌入城市）。类似能够表达“大量而来”含义的还有：swarm into（蜂拥而入），pour into（如潮水般涌入）flow into，rush into等。如：Hundreds of people rush into cities，especially big cities．They come for better jobs and better education，for better medical care，and for commerce and trade.（成百上千的人涌入城市尤其是大城市里，为了得到更好的工作或教育，得到更好的医疗保健，也为了开展商业贸易活动）。

\14. engulf：“吞没，淹没”，如：An almost unbearable loneliness engulfed her.（她陷入了一种几乎难以忍耐的寂寞）。类似含义的词有：overwhelm，submerge，immerse等，如：The whole nation was immersed in a festival atmosphere.（全国沉浸在节日的气氛中）。

**四、写作误区**

篇章结构误区：

在对图画描述部分，考生存在两个极端。一是描述非常简单，只是一句话代过，例如This is an American girl in traditional Chinese costume.，接着就开始发表议论。这样的问题出现很可能是考生词汇量太小，写作功底太薄，面对这样一个图片形式的描述无从下笔。有些考生也只写出了几个简单句子，如：The girl is laughing. The girl is wearing beautiful hat and clothes. She is happy. 另一个极端是局限于画面的具体内容，就事论事，用很大的篇幅来描写画面中服饰的细节。实际上在适当的描述后考生应当展开主题，按照题目的要求从“文化”这一概念入手。同样，文章也不应当写成中美或中西文化的对比。

语言表达错误： 

①用词错误：

We should develop China’s economic, and lead our country to a rich, strong nation.（We should develop China’s *economy,* and make our country *thriving and prosperous*）

②主谓搭配：

The picture shows an American girl who wearing the traditional Chinese costume.（The picture shows an American girl who *wears* the traditional Chinese costume.）

③句子不完整：

The importance of cultural communication just to let more foreigners know China.（The cultural communication *is to* let more foreigners know China.）

④不间断句子：

China opened the door to the world, more and more people visit China and become interested in Chinese culture. (*As* China opened the door to the world, more and more people visit China and become interested in Chinese culture.)

⑤句子结构混乱：

The way of people to do things will become similar if they communicate more with people belong to other cultures.（The way *in which people do things* will become similar if they communicate more with people *who belong* to other cultures.）

**Text 1**

Specialization can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units, one man could continue to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But specialization was only one of a series of related developments in science affecting the process of communication. Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific activity.

No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science: exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word “amateur” does carry a connotation that the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific community and, in particular, may not fully share its values. The growth of specialization in the nineteenth century, with its consequent requirement of a longer, more complex training, implied greater problems for amateur participation in science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the development of geology in the United Kingdom.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have continued to pursue local studies in the old way. The overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing, first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological journals in the twentieth century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals have now appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in local societies or to come together nationally in a different way.

Although the process of professionalisation and specialization was already well under way in British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed until the twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned as the crucial period for this change in the structure of science.

\51. The growth of specialization in the 19th century might be more clearly seen in sciences such as ________.

[A] sociology and chemistry

[B] physics and psychology

[C] sociology and psychology（D）

[D] physics and chemistry

\52. We can infer from the passage that ________.

[A] there is little distinction between specialization and professionalisation

[B] amateurs can compete with professionals in some areas of science

[C] professionals tend to welcome amateurs into the scientific community（B）

[D] amateurs have national academic societies but no local ones

\53. The author writes of the development of geology to demonstrate ________.

[A] the process of specialization and professionalisation

[B] the hardship of amateurs in scientific study

[C] the change of policies in scientific publications（A）

[D] the discrimination of professionals against amateurs

\54. The direct reason for specialization is ________.

[A] the development in communication

[B] the growth of professionalisation

[C] the expansion of scientific knowledge（C）

[D] the splitting up of academic societies

**Text 2**

A great deal of attention is being paid today to the so-called digital divide -- the division of the world into the info (information) rich and the info poor. And that divide does exist today. My wife and I lectured about this looming danger twenty years ago. What was less visible then, however, were the new, positive forces that work against the digital divide. There are reasons to be optimistic.

There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow. As the Internet becomes more and more commercialized, it is in the interest of business to universalize access -- after all, the more people online, the more potential customers there are. More and more governments, afraid their countries will be left behind, want to spread Internet access. Within the next decade or two, one to two billion people on the planet will be netted together. As a result, I now believe the digital divide will narrow rather than widen in the years ahead. And that is very good news because the Internet may well be the most powerful tool for combating world poverty that we’ve ever had.

Of course, the use of the Internet isn’t the only way to defeat poverty. And the Internet is not the only tool we have. But it has enormous potential.

To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to get over their outdated anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign investment. Countries that still think foreign investment is an invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history of infrastructure (the basic structural foundations of a society) in the United States. When the United States built its industrial infrastructure, it didn’t have the capital to do so. And that is why America’s Second Wave infrastructure -- including roads, harbors, highways, ports and so on -- were built with foreign investment. The English, the Germans, the Dutch and the French were investing in Britain’s former colony. They financed them. Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who owns them now? The Americans. I believe the same thing would be true in places like Brazil or anywhere else for that matter. The more foreign capital you have helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure, which today is an electronic infrastructure, the better off you’re going to be. That doesn’t mean lying down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign corporations run uncontrolled. But it does mean recognizing how important they can be in building the energy and telecom infrastructures needed to take full advantage of the Internet.

\55. Digital divide is something ________.

[A] getting worse because of the Internet

[B] the rich countries are responsible for

[C] the world must guard against（C）

[D] considered positive today

\56. Governments attach importance to the Internet because it ________.

[A] offers economic potentials

[B] can bring foreign funds

[C] can soon wipe out world poverty（A）

[D] connects people all over the world

\57. The writer mentioned the case of the United States to justify the policy of ________.

[A] providing financial support overseas

[B] preventing foreign capital’s control

[C] building industrial infrastructure（D）

[D] accepting foreign investment

\58. It seems that now a country’s economy depends much on ________.

[A] how well-developed it is electronically

[B] whether it is prejudiced against immigrants

[C] whether it adopts America’s industrial pattern（A）

[D] how much control it has over foreign corporations

**Text 3**

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? The American Society of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this painful question. The organization is deep into a long self-analysis known as the journalism credibility project.

Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors and spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement about what in the world those readers really want.

But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through a set of standard templates (patterns) into which they plug each day’s events. In other words, there is a conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-made narrative structure for otherwise confusing news.

There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which helps explain why the “standard templates” of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a recent survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around the country, plus one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned at random and asked the same questions.

Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, and trade stocks, and they’re less likely to go to church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community.

Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work tends to reflect the conventional values of this elite. The astonishing distrust of the news media isn’t rooted in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between reporters and their readers.

This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a troubled business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. Then it sponsors lots of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why customers are annoyed and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to noticing the cultural and class biases that so many former buyers are complaining about. If it did, it would open up its diversity program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values, education, and class.

\59. What is the passage mainly about?

[A] needs of the readers all over the world

[B] causes of the public disappointment about newspapers

[C] origins of the declining newspaper industry（B）

[D] aims of a journalism credibility project

\60. The results of the journalism credibility project turned out to be ________.

[B] somewhat contradictory

[C] very illuminating（D）

[D] rather superficial

[A] working attitude

[B] conventional lifestyle

[C] world outlook（C）

[D] educational background

[A] failure to realize its real problem

[B] tendency to hire annoying reporters

[C] likeliness to do inaccurate reporting（A）

[D] prejudice in matters of race and gender

**Text 4**

The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed. The process sweeps from hyperactive America to Europe and reaches the emerging countries with unsurpassed might. Many in these countries are looking at this process and worrying: “Won’t the wave of business concentration turn into an uncontrollable anti-competitive force?”

There’s no question that the big are getting bigger and more powerful. Multinational corporations accounted for less than 20% of international trade in 1982. Today the figure is more than 25% and growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing segment of production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment. In Argentina, for instance, after the reforms of the early 1990s, multinationals went from 43% to almost 70% of the industrial production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon has created serious concerns over the role of smaller economic firms, of national businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world economy.

I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower trade and investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable of meeting customer’s demands. All these are beneficial, not detrimental, to consumers. As productivity grows, the world’s wealth increases.

Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty. Yet it is hard to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to competition that were feared nearly a century ago in the U.S., when the Standard Oil Trust was broken up. The mergers of telecom companies, such as WorldCom, hardly seem to bring higher prices for consumers or a reduction in the pace of technical progress. On the contrary, the price of communications is coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing -- witness Daimler and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan -- but it does not appear that consumers are being hurt.

Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few weeks ago, Alan Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking industry. Who is going to supervise, regulate and operate as lender of last resort with the gigantic banks that are being created? Won’t multinationals shift production from one place to another when a nation gets too strict about infringements to fair competition? And should one country take upon itself the role of “defending competition” on issues that affect many other nations, as in the U.S. vs. Microsoft case?

\63. What is the typical trend of businesses today?

[A] to take in more foreign funds

[B] to invest more abroad

[C] to combine and become bigger（C）

[D] to trade with more countries

 

\64. According to the author, one of the driving forces behind M&A wave is ________.

[A] the greater customer demands

[B] a surplus supply for the market

[C] a growing productivity（A）

[D] the increase of the world’s wealth

\65. From Paragraph 4 we can infer that ________.

[A] the increasing concentration is certain to hurt consumers

[B] WorldCom serves as a good example of both benefits and costs

[C] the costs of the globalization process are enormous（D）

[D] the Standard Oil Trust might have threatened competition

\66. Toward the new business wave, the writer’s attitude can be said to be ________.

[A] optimistic

[B] objective

[C] pessimistic（B）

[D] biased

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might become a part of a new international trend. A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my professional progress prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of a disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming “I wanted to spend more time with my family”.

Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and two novels later, my experiment in what the Americans term “downshifting” has turned my tired excuse into an absolute reality. I have been transformed from a passionate advocate of the philosophy of “having it all,” preached by Linda Kelsey for the past seven years in the page of *She* magazine, into a woman who is happy to settle for a bit of everything.

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the editorship of *She* after a build-up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of “juggling your life,” and making the alternative move into “downshifting” brings with it far greater rewards than financial success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to return to the kind of life Kelsey used to advocate and I once enjoyed: 12-hour working days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain of office politics and the limitations of being a parent on “quality time”.

In America, the move away from juggling to a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle is a well-established trend. Downshifting -- also known in America as “voluntary simplicity” -- has, ironically, even bred a new area of what might be termed anti-consumerism. There are a number of best-selling downshifting self-help books for people who want to simplify their lives; there are newsletters, such as *The Tightwad Gazette*, that give hundreds of thousands of Americans useful tips on anything from recycling their cling-film to making their own soap; there are even support groups for those who want to achieve the mid-’90s equivalent of dropping out.

While in America the trend started as a reaction to the economic decline -- after the mass redundancies caused by downsizing in the late ’80s -- and is still linked to the politics of thrift, in Britain, at least among the middle-class downshifters of my acquaintance, we have different reasons for seeking to simplify our lives.

For the women of my generation who were urged to keep juggling through the ’80s, downshifting in the mid-’90s is not so much a search for the mythical good life -- growing your own organic vegetables, and risking turning into one -- as a personal recognition of your limitations.

[A] Full-time employment is a new international trend.

[B] The writer was compelled by circumstances to leave her job.

**Section IV English-Chinese Translation**

**Directions:**

Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written neatly on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (15 points)

In less than 30 years’ time the *Star Trek* holodeck will be a reality. Direct links between the brain’s nervous system and a computer will also create full sensory virtual environments, allowing virtual vacations like those in the film *Total Recall*.

71) There will be television chat shows hosted by robots, and cars with pollution monitors that will disable them when they offend. 72) Children will play with dolls equipped with personality chips, computers with in-built personalities will be regarded as workmates rather than tools, relaxation will be in front of smell-television, and digital age will have arrived.

According to BT’s futurologist, Ian Pearson, these are among the developments scheduled for the first few decades of the new millennium (a period of 1,000 years), when supercomputers will dramatically accelerate progress in all areas of life.

73) Pearson has pieced together the work of hundreds of researchers around the world to produce a unique millennium technology calendar that gives the latest dates when we can expect hundreds of key breakthroughs and discoveries to take place. Some of the biggest developments will be in medicine, including an extended life expectancy and dozens of artificial organs coming into use between now and 2040.

Pearson also predicts a breakthrough in computer-human links. “By linking directly to our nervous system, computers could pick up what we feel and, hopefully, simulate feeling too so that we can start to develop full sensory environments, rather like the holidays in *Total Recall* or the *Star Trek* holodeck,” he says. 74) But that, Pearson points out, is only the start of man-machine integration: “It will be the beginning of the long process of integration that will ultimately lead to a fully electronic human before the end of the next century.”

Through his research, Pearson is able to put dates to most of the breakthroughs that can be predicted. However, there are still no forecasts for when faster-than-light travel will be available, or when human cloning will be perfected, or when time travel will be possible. But he does expect social problems as a result of technological advances. A boom in neighborhood surveillance cameras will, for example, cause problems in 2010, while the arrival of synthetic lifelike robots will mean people may not be able to distinguish between their human friends and the droids. 75) And home appliances will also become so smart that controlling and operating them will result in the breakout of a new psychological disorder -- kitchen rage.

一、文章总体分析

本文是一篇报道性的文章，介绍了自露丝玛莉•韦斯特案件发生后，政府、法院、媒体各方面对于付款给证人的反应。文章第一段介绍了政府的反应：要禁止报界买断证人新闻的举动。第二至六段介绍了以大法官埃尔温勋爵为代表的法院在这个问题上的态度。最后一段介绍了露丝玛莉•韦斯特案件的始末。在该案件中由于很多证人通过讲述他们的经历而从媒体获得报酬，结果导致被告数罪并罚，被判十项无期徒刑。结论为付款给证人的做法成为一个颇有争议的问题。

二、试题具体解析

\31. 【答案】 D

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：逻辑关系。

解答该题时，考生需要判断空格前后部分prominent cases和The trial of Rosemary West之间的关系，前者泛指“一些著名的案件”，后者是一个具体的案件，即“对露丝玛莉•韦斯特案件的审判”，可见两者是例证关系。因此，所填入的选项应是一个表示“例如”或“像……一样”的连接词。首先排除as to和in particular。for instance（或for example）可表示“举例”，但放在句中多为插入语，且后面不可直接加宾语。如：Here in Chicago, for instance, the movement was growing by leaps and bounds.（比如在芝加哥，运动正在迅猛发展）。选项中只有介词短语such as可以接名词做宾语，表达“例如…，象这种的”的含义。

首段第一句话的结构比较复杂，中心句为The government is to ban payments to witnesses by newspapers（政府要禁止报界付钱给证人），现在分词结构seeking to buy up... Rosemary West 做后置定语，用来修饰newspapers，意为“试图收买涉及一些要案证人的报纸”。过去分词结构involved in也是后置定语，用来修饰people。整个句子的含义是：政府要禁止报界付钱给涉及一些要案（诸如审判露丝玛莉•韦斯特案）的证人以图收买他们的举动。

\32. 【答案】 A

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：习惯搭配 + 动词词义辨析。

本题的四个选项虽然都是动名词，但实际上考核的是能与controls搭配的中心动词。首先排除focus和fasten，focus意为“把注意力等集中在…”，如：You must try to focus your mind on work and study.（你应该努力把思想集中在工作和学习上）文章第一段只提到政府要禁止付款收买证人的这种做法，并没有涉及其它方面的情况，也就无所谓“集中法律控制”了。fasten表“扣紧，扎牢”的含义时多接具体名词，如：fasten our seat belts（系紧安全带），不适用于抽象名词control。intensify侧重于强调数量、活动、情感的增加或增强，不和control搭配，如：The press has intensified its scrutiny of the candidate’s background.（新闻界已加强了对侯选人的背景调查）；只有tighten与legal control搭配，表示“加强法律控制”。

知识点补充：常与control构成的搭配还有：gain/ take/lose/seize ～ of， have/hold ～ over, offer～，set up ～ 。 

\33. 【答案】 D

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：固定搭配。

本题要求考生判断哪个选项与bill搭配。draft bill是法律中的一个固定搭配，意为“草案，（提交议会讨论的）法案”；其他三个选项虽然不与bill搭配，但都可以表示类似于“初步的，不完整的，简略的”的含义，sketch的搭配有sketch map（略图、示意图），sketch plan（草拟计划）；rough的搭配有a rough drawing（草图）；preliminary强调“初步的”，如：a preliminary examination（初试）。 

 

\34. 【答案】B

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：上下文语义 + 形容词词义辨析。

空格所在部分是that引导的定语从句that will propose making payments to witnesses   4   ，修饰先行词bill，说明是怎样一种法案。其中从句的宾语是一个复合结构making payment to witness __4__，（使给证人支付报酬的行为…），解此题时，考生关键要判断这个草案在对待收买证人的问题上的态度是怎样的。

文章第一句提到“政府要禁止报界收买一些要案的证人的举动”，第二段首句紧接着提到“为了加强对报界的控制，大法官埃尔温勋爵将要提出这个法案”。从逻辑上讲，政府和大法官的行为应该是一致的。那么大法官提出法律草案的目的也是反对报界收买证人的做法。illegal强调不符合法律规定，符合题意。其他三个选项都不符合语义，illogical强调不合逻辑，如：Sometimes illogical behaviors may result in a great invention.（有时不合逻辑的做法可能会导致伟大的发明）；improbable指可能性很小，如：It is improbable that she will go.（她不大可能会走）；improper表示“不得体”，若用在本题中，语气太弱，如：an act improper to the occasion（不合时宜的行为）。

35.【答案】 A 

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：逻辑语义搭配。

空格所在部分是：a bill that will propose …and will strictly control the amount of _ 5__ that can be given to a case。从结构上看，空格处填入的名词，既是control的宾语，又是that引导的定语从句修饰的先行词，即符合give sth. to a case的搭配。符合这两个要求的只有选项A. publicity，give publicity to sth.（宣扬/公布某事）为常用搭配。整个句子大意为：草案提议对报界付款给证人的做法定为非法，并严格控制案件的公开程度。

词汇补充：the penalty for speeding（超速罚款）；enjoy／win general popularity（受欢迎）；One of the peculiarities of his behavior is that he shouts instead of talking.（他的一种怪癖是说话总爱高声嚷）。

 

 

36．【答案】 C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：上下文语义 + 逻辑推理。

本题需要考生判断空格处应填入什么连词来连接这两个动作：“严格限制案件的公开程度”和“审判开始”。根据上下文逻辑推理，政府之所以要禁止报界付钱给案件的证人，是因为新闻界要把这些证人的观点公诸于众，这些观点难免夹杂个人的因素，而司法要求的是公正，不能因为这些观点影响案件的审理。因此要严格控制的应该是案件在审理开始“之前”（before）就过分公开。

\37. 【答案】 D

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：习惯搭配 + 动词短语语义辨析。

本题考查了动词与with sth.的搭配。四个选项都能与with搭配，关键是看哪个能与后面的宾语a committee report（委员会的报告）搭配。先排除选项B和C，因为我们不能说“分享报告”或“遵守报告”。而side with后一般连接“某人”，如：He sided with the conservatives in Congress.（他在国会中支持保守派）。只有agreed with合适，意为“埃尔温勋爵阐明自己赞同委员会今年的报告”。

例句补充：He shared the story with us.（他给我们讲了这个故事）；The patient complied with the physician’s orders.（病人遵从医生的嘱咐）。

\38. 【答案】 B

【解析】本题考核的知识点是：动词词义辨析。

本题空格处再次考查了动词与control的搭配。根据上下文，这里指的应是埃尔温勋爵批评报界收买证人，随意公开案件的情况，自我约束力度不够。四个选项中，manifest和indicate的含义明显不符合文意。offer属于使用非常广泛的词语，当表示“给”的含义时等于give，它放入文中，表达的含义是：自我约束（self-regulation）不能提供足够的监控。present一般指正式的呈递，如：The committee is presenting its investigation report next week.（委员会将于下星期提出调查报告）。

例句补充：He doesn’t manifest much interest in his studies.（他对学业没多大兴趣）；The symptoms indicate immediate surgery.（症状表明需要立即做外科手术）。

\39. 【答案】 B

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：名词词义辨析。

空格所在句子指出，“这封信的…在两天后发生了”。四个选项中，Release有“准许发表，发布”的意思，但它强调的是经过努力才得以发表，多用于消息（发布）、影片或者书籍（发行）；若用printing表示“两天后把信打印出来”显然不对；exposure多指“暴露或揭露一些不好的事情，如违法或犯罪行为”，如：exposure of graft in the government.（对政府贪污的揭露）；因此正确答案是publication，表达的含义是“两天后，这封信便公布于众”。

\40. 【答案】 A

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：固定搭配 + 名词词义辨析。

空格所在部分是：Lord Irvine caused a   10  of media protest，这里描述了媒体抗议的程度。从结构上来看，填入的名词应与“media protest”搭配。从文意来看，其含义应是“（引起了）一片（媒体的抗议）”。storm 可以与a…of的形式搭配，表示“一阵猛烈的情感爆发或一阵风波”，如：a storm of tears（泪如雨下），a storm of protest（一阵/片猛烈的抗议）。

rage也表示“暴怒、大怒”，但是搭配形式只能是a rage，如：be in a rage，flew into a rage（勃然大怒）；flare在a…of搭配中仅表示“一阵怒气”，它不和media protest搭配，如：a flare of temper（大发雷霆），a flare of resentment（一阵怒气）；flash表示突然闪现的东西，如：a flash of hope（一线希望），a flash of wit（灵光一现）等。因此用a storm of修饰media protest形象地描绘了媒体抗议的激烈程度。

\41. 【答案】 B

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：名词词义辨析。

本题考查哪个名词能和privacy controls搭配，从意义上来看，只有 interpretation 符合题意。“the interpretation of privacy controls”意为“隐私控制的解释权”。注意translation和interpretation及各自的动词形式都是近义词，可以表示“翻译”，但表示“解释、阐释（语言以外的东西）”之义时不能用translate，只能用interpret，相当于explain，如：How can I interpreted his behavior?（我怎么解释他的行为）。

\42. 【答案】 C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：介词短语辨析。

本题空格前后连接的是两个介词短语（left）to judges（留给法官）与（left）to Parliament（留给国会），它们描述的对象都是interpretation of private controls，显然两者在意义上是不能共存的，只能选其一。因此空格处要填入一个含有选择意义的词。先排除better than和sooner than，前者表达程度比较，后者反映速度比较。other than表达选择概念时可意为“不同于”，如：The result was quite other than we had expected.（结果和我们预期的不同），但是根据上下文，“把隐私控制的解释权留给法官不同于留给国会”本身就是客观事实，不至于会引起媒体的一片抗议，因此可推知rather than最恰当，意为“是…而不是”，如：These shoes are comfortable rather than pretty.（这双鞋子是舒服而不是好看）。文中意思为“把隐私控制的解释权留给法官而不留给国会”。

43.【答案】B

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：动词用法。

本题所在句子的结构是which引导的一个非限制性定语从句，从句的主语是which指代的the Human Rights Bill。从本题和下一题的选项可看出两个空格应分别填入动词和形容词。那么从句的基本结构应是：动词+宾语（the European Convention on Human Rights）+形容词（宾语补足语）。由此可见，所选的动词应能接宾补。从语法上来看，四个选项中，make常接形容词做宾语补足语，如：made her position clear（使她的地位明朗化）；set也可以接宾语补足语，但宾补一般是现在分词、不定式或介词短语，很少用形容词，只有：set the boy right（纠正孩子的错误），a good rest will set you right（休息将使你的精神得到恢复），set the prisoners free（把囚犯释放出来），set your hat straight（把帽子带正）等情况。因此make为正确答案，放入空格意为“使《欧洲人权公约》在法律上…”。

\44. 【答案】 A

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：上下文语义 + 形容词词义辨析。

从上一题的分析可知，空格填入的形容词做make复合结构的宾补：make the European Convention on Human Rights legally  14  。其次根据上下文，the Human Rights Bill…laid down that everybody was  15  to privacy and that public figures could go to court to protect themselves and their families（人权法案规定每一个人都…隐私权，公众人物可以走上法庭去保护自己和他们的家人），因此从《人权法案》的具体内容看，它对《欧洲人权公约》的影响应该是使其在法律上有约束力（binding），而不仅仅是“具有说服力”，更不是“具有说服力”或“抑制的”。因此A选项符合题意。

\45. 【答案】C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：习惯搭配 + to的用法。

空格所在部分的搭配是be +过去分词+to sth.，其中to是介词。四个选项中，be authorized to do sth. 意为“被授权……”，其中to是不定式符号，不是介词，如：She was authorized by her partner to negotiate with the dealer.（她的合伙人授权她与经销商谈判）；be credited to sth.意为“把…归于某人或某物，认为属于……”，如：Superpowers are credited to the big stone.（人们认为这块大石头有超能），该词组虽然在语法上可行，但在文中表达的意思是“把每个人归于隐私”显然逻辑不通；be qualified to do sth.意为“有资格，能胜任”，但其中的to不是介词，是不定式符号，后面要接动词原形，如：He is qualified to teach English.（他有资格教英语）。符合题意的be entitled to sth.是个固定搭配，意为“有权……，有资格……”，如：He is entitled to the pension.（他有权领取养老金）。

\46. 【答案】 A

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：介词的用法。

本题考查哪个介词可以与in safe hands（安然无恙）搭配。空格所在句子是Press freedoms will be in safe hands   16   our British judges（新闻自由由法官掌握将安然无恙），介词中只有with可表达“由…掌握，由…负责”的含义，例句：I shall leave the child with you.（我将把这孩子交给你）。

\47. 【答案】 D

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：上下文语义 + 名词词义辨析。

本题要求考生判断“自West被判十次无期徒刑后，付款给证人的做法成为了什么”。首先考生需知道West和前面提到的the trial of Rosemary West联系起来，这个事件的影响很大，政府和法官都意识到要严格控制报界付款给证人的行为。由此可以推断出付款给证人的做法应该成为颇有争议的问题（issue），而不只是一个事件（incident），或推断（inference），或冲击（impact）。虽然impact也有“影响”的含义，但和不定冠词搭配只能是have/make a great impact on sth.，例句：This book had a great impact on its readers.（这本书对读者有很大的影响）。

\48. 【答案】 C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：动词用法辨析。

本题所在部分是Up to 19 witnesses were   18   to have received payments，其谓语动词是被动语态的复合结构：be +过去分词+ to have done sth.。适用这个结构的只有said和told，但be told to have done sth.意为“被告知做过某事”，不符合句意。正确答案只有C，be said to have done sth.意为“据说做过某事”，本句可译为：据说多达19个证人因向报社讲述他们的故事而获得报酬。

\49. 【答案】 D

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：同位语从句中的关系代词。

空格后面部分是concerns的同位语，表明其具体内容。选项中能引导同位语从句的关系代词只有that。注意：同位语从句本来应该直接跟在先行词concerns后面，但因为从句太长，会显得头重脚轻，所以放在了后面，达到句子平衡的效果。

知识点补充：同位语从句接在名词后，对名词作进一步解释，说明其具体内容。这类名词包括：belief （相信），conclusion（结论），decision（决定），doubt（怀疑），evidence（证据），fact（事实），hope（希望），idea（想法），information（消息），news（消息），probability（可能），problem（问题），rumor（传闻），suggestion（建议），truth（真理）等等。

\50. 【答案】 C

【解析】 本题考核的知识点是：动词词义辨析。

guilty verdicts意为“（陪审团的）定罪决定”。空格所在句子意为：证人被鼓励在法庭上夸大事实，目的就为了…定罪。考生需判断哪个动词可以与guilty verdicts搭配。assure后面一般接人，表示消除别人的疑虑，如：I can assure you of its quality.（我可以向您保证它的质量）。confide接sth.时，意为“吐露（内幕），托付”，如：He confided his troubles to a friend.（他向朋友倾诉烦恼事），confide my property to your care.（把我的财产托付你保管）。显然这两个含义都不符合文意。guarantee接sth.时意为“担保…质量，保证，落实”等，当含义是“保证”时多接褒义的名词，如：guarantee a good crop（保证了好收成）；ensure意为“保证，担保，使…一定得到”，强调对某行为有把握，根据文意，证人的目的就是想确保让被告得到定罪，因此ensure最符合句意。

三、全文翻译

政府要禁止报界付钱给涉及一些要案的证人以图收买他们的举动。审判露丝玛莉•韦斯特案就是这样的一起案子。

为了加强对报界的法律控制，大法官埃尔温勋爵将要提出一个法案的草案。这一法案将提议把报界付款给证人的做法定为非法，并且，法案还严格对案件在开庭前的公开程度加以限制。

在给下院媒体选择委员会主席格拉德•考夫曼的一封信中，埃尔温勋爵说他同意该委员会今年的报告。该报告指出对媒体的自我约束没有实施足够的监控。当埃尔温勋爵说对于欧洲立法中所包含的关于隐私权的控制的解释权将留给法官而不是国会时，他的这一作法遭到了媒体的一片抗议。两天后，这封信便公布于众。

大法官说《人权法案》的引入使《欧洲人权公约》在英国具有了法律约束力。它规定每个人都享有个人隐私权，公众人物可以走上法庭去保护自己和家人的权利。

“新闻自由由法官掌握将安然无恙”，他说道。

自韦斯特在1995年被判处十项无期徒刑后，给证人付报酬的做法就成了颇有争议的问题。据说多达十九个证人因向报社讲述他们的经历而获得报酬。这引起了人们的关注：证人为了确保法庭给被告定罪，可能会被怂恿在法庭上夸大事实。

**Section III: Reading Comprehension (40 points)** 　　**Text 1** **一、文章结构总体分析**

这是一篇论述科学发展的专业化和职业化的文章。全文客观地描述这一过程，并且以英国地质学的发展为例说明专业化发展导致专业人员和业余人员之间的分化越来越明显。

第一段：科学知识的积累导致知识的进一步分类和分化，即专业化发展。与专业化发展同时并存的另一现象是科学活动的日益职业化。

第二段：专业化的发展给业余研究者的进入带来了困难，这种趋势在某些科学领域尤为突出。

第三、四段指出：以英国地质学研究为例，说明专业人员和业余人员之间分化越来越明显。而这种专业化和职业化的分化过程早在19世纪英国的地质学领域就已经开始形成。

 

**二、试题具体解析**

\51. **［答案］D**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题 + 常识**。

文章第二段最后两句话指出，“19世纪专业化的发展要求时间更长、内容更复杂的培训，这使得非专业研究人员面临越来越大的困难。这个趋势在以数学训练或实验室训练为基础的科学领域显得更为突出。”四个选项中涉及社会学、化学、物理学、心理学四个学科。根据常识，物理学、化学与地质学都是以数学和实验室培训为基础的科学，而社会学和心理学则不是。比较四个选项只有D选项“物理和化学”是正确答案。

\52. **［答案］B**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

文章第一段最后两句指出，“专业化仅仅是科学领域内影响交流过程的一系列相关科学发展的现象之一，另一现象是科学活动的日益职业化。”由此可知，专业化和职业化是两个不同的过程，因而可排除A选项；第二段最后一句指出“专业化的发展给业余研究者的进入带来了困难，这种趋势在某些科学领域尤为突出”，其暗含的意思是在另外一些领域非专业人员可以和专业人员去竞争，B选项表达了此意，是正确答案。在此基础上，第三段更是举出英国地质学研究的例子来说明专业人员与非专业人员出现的越来越明显的分化，因此Ｃ选项明显错误；D选项与第三段最后一句“业余人员有两种选择：或者呆在地方研究团体中，或者以另外一种方式在全国范围内联合”不符。

\53. **［答案］A**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**作者意图题**。

作者在第二段末句提到，业余研究者很难进入专业领域的趋势可以通过英国地质学发展的例子很好地来说明。第三段谈到英国地质学研究中出版标准的变化、专业和业余人员的不同研究方式、业余人员在专业刊物上发表论文的困难及专业和业余两种不同的刊物和学会的形成。可见，作者举例的目的是描述职业化和专业化形成的过程，A选项正确。

B选项和C选项都是第三段提到的职业化和专业化发展过程中的具体表现，并不是例子旨在说明的问题。D选项文中未明确提出。

\54. **［答案］C**

**［解析］**本题考核的知识点是：**细节题**

第一段第一句指出，“专业化过程可以看作是对科学知识不断积累问题的反映”，其中response to与题干中的direct reason对应，因此C选项正确。文中提到A选项受专业化过程影响（一段末句），B选项是与专业化发展并存的现象，D选项是专业化发展造成的结果，因此都不是专业化的直接原因。

句子主干是the word“amateur”does carry a connotation，后面是that引导的同位语从句，从句的主干是：the person is not fully integrated into *and* not fully share，其中包含了两个并列谓语。

​    ② The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the development of geology in the United Kingdom.

句子主干是The trend was obvious in...and can be illustrated in terms of...。science后接过去分词based on做定语。In terms of“以…观点/方式，就…而说”。

③ A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what constitutes an acceptable research paper. 

句子主干是A comparison reveals not simply...but also...，并列连词not only…but also连接两个并列宾语emphasis和definition，宾语后都接有介词短语做定语。 

​    ④ The overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing, first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological journals in the twentieth century. 

句子主干是The result has been to make entrance harder for amateurs, a result…。逗号后面部分a result相当于the result has been a result，a result后是that引导的定语从句，其中存在两套被动结构，一是a result has been reinforced by the introduction of refereeing，另一套是 first the introduction of refereeing first by …and then by…。make sth. harder for sb.意为“使某事对于某人来说更难了”；referee原义为“当裁判，裁决”，句中意为“（出版）评审制度”。

佳句赏析:

Thus, in the nineteenth century, local geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the wider geological picture. 

该句由but连接两个分句，前后两个不同的时间状语表现了一种对比。结构严谨，对比鲜明，给人一目了然之感。

专业化可被视为针对科学知识不断膨胀这个问题所做出的反应。通过将学科细化成小单元，人们能够继续处理这些不断膨胀的信息并将它们作为深入研究的基础。但是专业化仅是科学领域内一系列影响交流过程的有关现象之一。另一现象是科学活动的日益职业化。

在科学领域内，专业人员与业余人员之间没有绝对的区分：任何规则都有其例外。**但是“业余”这个词的确有含义：那就是所指的那个人没有完全融入某个科学家群体，特别是，他可能并不完全认同这个群体的价值观**。（长难句①）19世纪的专业化的发展，以及随之而来的对训练的长期性和复杂性的要求，对业余人员进入科学界造成了更大的困难。**这一趋势在以数学训练或实验室训练为基础的科学领域里自然表现得最为突出，英国地质学的发展可以说明这一问题**（长难句②）**。**

**把英国最近一个半世纪的地质学刊物作一比较，人们发现，不仅研究的重要性越来越受到强调，而且学术论文的出版标准也在不断地发生变化**（长难句③）**。因此，在19世纪，局部的地质学研究本身就代表了一种有价值的科研；而到了20世纪，局部的研究只有在包含或考虑到更广阔的地质面貌时才越来越被专业人员接受**（佳句）**。**另一方面业余人员继续以旧的方式从事局部的研究。**结果是，业余人员更难在专业地质刊物上发表论文。这种结果因为评审制度的引入表现得更突出。开始是19世纪国家级杂志的引入，后来是20世纪数家地方地质杂志的引入**（长难句④）**。**这样发展的必然结果是出现了针对专业读者和业余读者的不同杂志。类似的分化过程也导致专业地质学家聚集起来，形成一两个全国性的团体，而业余地质学家则要么留在地方性团体中，要么以不同方式组成全国性的团体。

虽然职业化和专业化过程在19世纪的英国地质学界中己经开始形成，但是它的效果却延迟到20世纪才充分显示出来。然而，从科学这个整体来看，I9世纪必须被视为科学结构发生变化的关键时期。

 

**Text 2**

**一、文章结构总体分析**

本文主要讨论因特网在信息时代的重要性及如何利用外资帮助贫困国家搞好第三次电子基础建设。作者从“数字化分界”（digital divide）的概念入手，谈及互联网对消除数字化分界的作用，最后呼吁贫困国家积极引用外资普及互联网。

文章从意群上讲，主要为两个部分：前两段是一个意群，后两段是另一个意群。

第一段：前半部分提出很多人对于数字化分界的出现比较担忧，但是作者认为情况还是令人乐观的。段落最后一句为主题句。

第二段：结构为总—分—总，第一句为主题句，中间部分说理论证，倒数第二句话进行总结。该段从技术角度证明数字化分界会缩小。本段最后一句话实际是下一段的主题句，即互联网可以用来摆脱贫困。

第三、四段：要想充分利用互联网，就要积极利用外资。无论是在第二次基础建设浪潮中的美国，还是现在第三次电子基础建设浪潮(指电子产业设施，如：互联网)中的贫困国家，外资引进同样十分重要。该段落使用说理和例证两种论证方法。

 

**二、试题具体解析**


 

**55.[****答案] C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

本题要求考生把握作者对数字化分界的基本态度和观点。关键是对文章第一句话的理解。该句提到，今天所谓的数字化分界正在被高度重视。接下来作者提到，他和妻子20年前就在讲演中谈到这种**隐约出现的危险**（looming danger），这里的danger当然是指前面提到的“the digital divide”，即数字化分界。既然是危险，当然要警惕。因此C选项为正确答案。A选项与文章第二段谈到利用“technological reasons”即“Internet”可以缩小数字化分界相矛盾；无论从首段对数字化分界的定义中或是下面对缩小数字化分界的论述中，都可知D选项与作者的态度相反。文中没有提及这一现象是谁造成，由谁负责，因此B选项不对。

词汇补充：loom隐现，迫近，常令人生畏，如：An enormous shape looms in the distance, out of the darkness.


 

**56.[****答案] A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**因果关系题**。

本题要求考生弄清各种因果关系。通过题干关键词“Governments”和“Internet”定位到第二段。该段提到，随着互联网越来越趋于商业化，普及上网（universalize access）符合商家的利益，因为网络会给他们带来更多的潜在顾客。因此，各国政府惟恐落后于形势，都想普及上网（spread Internet access）。可见，政府关心的是互联网带来的经济利益。因此，A选项为正确答案。

B选项因果颠倒。全文第四段重点谈到利用外资可以发展互联网。C选项“不切实际。虽然作者提到了互联网可能是战胜贫困的工具，但是这仅仅是一种潜力，把这种力量转化为现实还取决于很多因素。D选项只能是互联网的一种功能，但不是政府关注的直接原因。


 

**57.[****答案] D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者意图题**。

本题要求考生辨析作者的写作目的。例证的写作手法通常采用论点—例子，例子—论点，或论点—例子—重申论点的形式，因此考生要到例子前后去寻找该论据所要说明的论点是什么。在最后一段的例子中作者介绍了美国在第二次基础设施浪潮期间是如何利用外资搞好基础建设的。在举例之前，作者建议贫困国家应该抛弃认为外国投资是对本国主权入侵的陈腐观点。举例之后，作者更直接指出，哪个国家利用外资多（The more foreign capital），哪个国家就将更富裕（the better off）。D选项正是作者举这个例子要提倡的。A选项与文意相反；B选项是作者建议人们不要担心的；C选项是例子中谈到的事实，但不是作者想要说明的问题。


 

**58.[****答案]** A

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**引申推理题**。

文章最后一段提到现在第三次电子基础建设浪潮（Third Wave infrastructure, which today is an electronic infrastructure）中哪个国家接受的外资越多就越富有，言外之意是利用外资进行电子基础建设才是富有与否的关键。这足以说明A选项 “其电子工业发展的程度”对于一个国家经济发展的重要作用。

B选项和D选项的内容文中根本未提到。作者谈到美国，只是作为一个引用外资建设基础设施的成功范例，而不是提倡完全效仿它的模式。所以C选项也不对。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析:

①As the Internet becomes more and more commercialized, it is in the interest of business to universalize access—after all, the more people online, the more potential customers there are. 

该句子的主句是it is in the interest of sb to do sth.（做某事符合某人的利益），前面是As引导的状语从句表伴随：随着…，破折号后面的一句话是对主句的解释。

②To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to get over their outdated anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign investment.

该句结构并不复杂，关键注意其中的几个介词短语的使用，get over克服，从……中恢复过来；with respect to，涉及、提到或关于某事物。主句前是to引导的目的状语从句。

③The more foreign capital you have helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure, which today is an electronic infrastructure, the better off you’re going to be. 

该句中有一个比较级的固定结构the more…the more，表示“越……越……”，which引导的定语从句解释前面的Third Wave infrastructure。

佳句赏析:

①And that is very good news because the Internet may well be the most powerful tool for combating world poverty that we’ve ever had.

句中may well+动词原形结构相当于have good reason to，意为“理应，有足够的理由”。如：He may well be proud of his son.（他大可以以他的儿子为荣）。该句子用这个结构来强调“网络完全可以成为最有力的工具来战胜世界贫困”。

②Countries that still think foreign investment is an invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history of infrastructure (the basic structural foundations of a society) in the United States. 

Might/may (as) well +动词原形结构常常用来建议或劝说某人采取某种活动，有时相当于had better，译为“还不如，不妨”。如：Students that still have some problem with this lesson might well ask me after class.（那些对这篇课文仍然有问题的同学不如课后再问一下我）。该句中作者建议那些抱有偏见的人不妨研究一下美国基础设施建设的历史。

 

**四、全文翻译**

今天，人们正在高度重视所谓数字化分界——世界上信息资源丰富的地区和信息资源贫乏的地区之间的差异。这个差异确实存在，我和我妻子20年前就曾就当时出现的这种临近的危险做过演讲。然而，那时还不太明显的是一些抵制数字化分界的、新的积极因素。现在我们是完全有理由感到乐观的。

一些技术上的因素使我们有理由期望数字化分界会缩小。**随着互联网的日趋商业化，普及上网对商家是有利的——毕竟，上网人数越多，潜在的客户就越多**（长难句①）**。**越来越多的政府，惟恐自己的国家落后，纷纷推广互联网的普及。未来一二十年之内，全球将有一二十亿人加入互联网。因此，我认为在未来的数年中，数字化分界将缩小而不会变大。**那是好消息，因为互联网完全可以成为我们战胜所面临的贫困的最强有效的工具**（佳句①）。

当然，使用互联网不是惟一战胜贫困的方法。互联网也不是我们所拥有的惟一工具，但它却有巨大的潜力。

**要想利用互联网这一工具，某些贫困国家必须克服对外国投资所持的过时了的反殖民主义偏见**（长难句②）**。那些认为外国投资是侵犯本国主权的国家不妨研究一下美国的基础设施（社会的基本结构基础）建设历史**（佳句②）。当初美国建设自己的工业基础设施时，缺乏必要的资金，因此美国的第二次浪潮基础设施建设，包括公路、港口、高速公路、港口城市等等——都是用国外资金建造的。英国人、德国人、荷兰人和法国人都在前英国殖民地投资。他们提供资金，美洲移民建造。想想看，现在谁拥有这一切？美国人。我想，在这件事上，像巴西或其他任何地方同样也该这样。**你拥有的去建造第三次浪潮基础设施建设（今天主要指电子基础设施）的外国资金越多，那么你的情况就越好**（长难句③）**。**这并不是说卑躬屈膝，任人愚弄，也不是对外国公司不加控制。但这的确意味着你已认识到外国公司对本国能源及通信基础设施建设的重要性，这些基础设施是充分利用互联网所必要的。

 

**Text 3**

 

**一、文章结构分析**

这是一篇关于美国新闻媒体遭受不信任危机的文章。文章介绍了一个针对此不信任危机而开展的调查，并阐述造成这一危机的原因，也是调查失败的原因。文章前两段交待了背景，第三段首先给出主题，在下面的三段中，逐步深入地追寻其背后的深层次原因，最后两段进行总结。整篇文章的论证方法主要是说理。

第一段：第一句以疑问句的形式提出问题，并指出该调查的目的。

第二段：直接指出该调查的结果不令人满意。

第三段：第一句为主题句——对媒体不信任是由于深层次原因。本段中“in other words”说明本段的论证方法是典型的说理。

第四段：进一步举例说明上段提到的新闻“标准模式”与普通人的生活相距甚远。

第五段：进一步指出这种差距是由于新闻界人士的生活态度导致的。

第六段：对文章观点进行总结。

第七段：指出这一趋势的危害。

 

**二、试题具体解析**


 

59.**[****答案] B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**文章主旨题**。

文章首段就是主题段。第一句提出本文的主旨问题“为什么那么多美国人不相信自己在报纸上看到的东西？”这就是整个文章要回答的问题，也是以疑问句形式出现的文章主题，是主旨问题的一个改写。因而B选项为答案。选项中的disappointment是原文中distrust的近义词。

A选项与文章谈的新闻遭受的信任危机无关，并非文章主要内容。文章只有最后第一段首句提到报业是一个日趋衰败的行业，但是未对衰败原因进行探究，所以C选项不对。D选项仅仅在第二段提及这一项目的内容和发现，属于细节内容，而非主题内容。

答题技巧：答主旨类型的题目关键是找到主题段（一般为首段）或其他各段的主题句（一般为首句）。一般而言，主题段包含文章主题思想。如无主题段，则找到各段的主题句加以归纳和总结，便可得出文章中心。


 

**60.[****答案] D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

第二段涉及该调查的结果。该段指出“这次新闻机构可信度的调查计划只得出一些极其肤浅的结论（low-level findings）诸如新闻报道中的事实错误，拼写或语法错误，和这些低层次发现交织在一起的还有许多令人挠头的困惑,譬如读者到底想读些什么。”因此 D选项是正确答案，答案中的superficial是原文low-level的近义词。其他三个选项文中均未提及，也无法推导出。

答题技巧：对于这类形容词的选项，考生首先可以判断这些词哪些是褒义，哪些是贬义，以便缩小范围。例如，本题中考生如果先确定作者对于该发现的态度为否定的话，就可以把答案首先确定到B、D两个选项内，接下来需要考虑的问题就是“矛盾”还是“肤浅”。


 

**61.[****答案] C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

第六段指出，“读者对新闻媒介令人震惊的不信任的根源不是……，而是记者与读者的世界观每天都发生着碰撞（the daily clash of world views）”。因此，C选项为正确答案。

A选项文中未提及。B选项和D选项应该属于记者和读者不同的两个方面，但仅是表面现象，不是问题的根本说在。


 

**62.[****答案] A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

最后一段谈到新闻业为此做出的种种努力，如“出资组织研讨会和可信度调查项目、探究为什么顾客们恼火以及为什么会有那么多人逃避新闻”；接着用but话锋一转，指出他们没有做到的方面，即“但是它似乎从来就没有回过头去注意文化方面和阶级方面的偏见，而这正是很多以前的顾客抱怨的内容”。由此可以总结得出，他们的问题就是没有对症下药。因此A选项是正确答案。

B选项、C选项都是表面现象，和D选项均与该段最后一句“这个项目现在还只是单纯考虑招收不同种族和性别的员工”的事实不符。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

① Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors and spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement about what in the world those readers really want.

句子主干是...this project has turned out to be ... findings ...。about factual errors and spelling and grammar mistakes是宾语findings的补语成分；后接过去分词combined引导的伴随状语，其中about what in the world those readers really want是puzzlement的补语。

② Most journalists learn to see the world through a set of standard templates (patterns) into which they plug each day’s events. In other words, there is a conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-made narrative structure for otherwise confusing news.

这两句生动地介绍了新闻界的工作方式。两句各自含有一个定语从句，第一句中的定语从句为into which they plug each day’s events，修饰前面的中心名词into which they plug each day’s events，后一句中的定语从句由that引导，修饰前面的a conventional story line。

知识点补充：“plug sth. into sth.”意为“塞入、插入”；“story line”指“叙述故事的线路、套路”；“culture”在这指“某群体或民族的风俗、人文现象、社会惯例”，如： enterprise culture.（企业文化）。

③ If it did, it would open up its diversity program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values, education, and class.

此句为虚拟语气，主要结构为：If it did, it would open up...and look for...。其中在由and连接的两个并列谓语，插入成分now focused narrowly on race and gender为过去分词形式的后置定语，修饰program。第二个谓语结构中，宾语reporters后面有一个who引导的定语从句。

佳句赏析：

Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, and trade stocks, and they’re less likely to go to church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in community.

句子中are more likely to... and ... are less likely to...后都跟了三个不定式做补语，前后对应，结构严谨，给人一种层次美。

 

**四、全文翻译**

为什么那么多美国人不相信自己在报纸上看到的东西？美国新闻编辑协会正试图回答这个痛苦问题。该组织正深深陷入一个长期的自我剖析过程中，即，一个称为新闻可信度的调查项目。 

**遗憾的是，这次新闻机构可信度调查计划结果只获得了一些肤浅的发现，诸如新闻报道中的事实错误，拼写或语法错误，和这些低层次发现交织在一起的还有许多令人挠头的困惑,譬如读者到底想读些什么**。（长难句①）

但这种对媒体的不信任有更深刻的根源。**多数新闻记者都学着用一套标准的模式去看待世界，并把每天发生的事件套入这一模式即可。换言之，在媒体的新闻采编室文化中存在着一套约定俗成的写作模式，为纷繁复杂的新闻报道提供了一个主干框架和一个现成的故事叙述套路**。（长难句②） 

新闻记者和读者之间存在着社会和文化方面的脱节，这就是为什么新闻编辑室的“标准模式”与众多读者的意趣相差甚远。在最近一次调查中，问卷被送到了全国五座中等城市及一座大都市的记者手中，然后随机地给这些城市的居民打电话，问他们同样的问题。 

**结果表明，与其他美国人相比，新闻记者更有可能居住在富人区，有女佣，有奔驰车，炒股，而不大可能去教堂，参加志愿服务，扎根某个社区**。（佳句）

记者们往往属于广义的社会和文化精英的一个部分，因此他们的工作往往反映了这些精英的传统价值观。读者对新闻媒介令人震惊的不信任，其根源并非是报道失实或低下的报道技巧，而是记者与读者的世界观每天都发生着碰撞。 

这对任何一个行业来说，都是一个句有破坏力的形势，对于一个正在衰落的行业来说尤其如此。这是一个有很多麻烦的行业，却不断地雇佣观点总使客户恼怒的雇员。然后它又出资组织研讨会和可信度调查项目，去探究为什么顾客们生气，而大量流失。但它似乎从来就没回过头来去注意那么多以前的顾客所抱怨的文化和阶级偏见。**如果它能注意这个问题的话，它就应该进一步开放其多样化项目（这个项目现在还只单纯考虑招收不同种族和性别的员工），进一步寻找那些世界观、价值观、教育水平和社会阶层各不相同的记者**。（长难句③）

 

**Text 4**

**一、文章结构总体分析**

本文是关于企业兼并与收购的一篇文章。作者从目前的兼并与收购浪潮现象着手，分析其产生的原因及带来的影响。

第一段：首句提出世界正在经历一场兼并与收购浪潮，段尾以问句的方式提出文章主题：这种兼并是否会演变成一种无法控制的反竞争力量？

第二段：用数据证明了企业合并形式之一，即跨国公司贸易的增长。

第三段：解释了造成企业合并现象的原因。

第四段：分析了合并热潮的影响，认为它没有给消费和技术进步带来危害，还有可能使世界财富增长。该段论证中既进行推理也使用了例证。

第五段：第一句为本段主题，即：人们对这种兼并还需要加以注意。论证中使用较多反意疑问句以加强语气。

 

**二、试题具体解析**


 

\63. **[****答案] C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

文章第一段就指出，当今企业界出现的一个现象，即整个世界正在经历一场前所未有的（ever witnessed）兼并与收购浪潮（wave of mergers and acquisitions，或M&A wave ）。这一并购之风从异常活跃的美国到达欧洲，并以不可比拟的威力（unsurpassed might）影响到新兴经济国家。接着第二段谈到跨国公司在世界范围内贸易的迅猛增长。因此，C选项即文中多次提到的mergers and acquisitions，是当今企业发展的主要趋势。其他三项都不符文意。

答题技巧：命题者的意图在于考核考生能否把握该段段落主旨句为首句，并且理解句中关键字眼mergers and acquisitions的意义。


 

**64.[****答案] A**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

第三段剖析造成并购潮流的重要原因。它们和导致经济全球化过程的因素是一样的，如：交通运输成本的日趋下降、贸易和投资壁垒的降低和扩大了的市场以满足需要扩大运作而方能满足顾客的需求。显然，A选项即为上面提到的三个因素之一，为正确答案。B选项即市场供应过剩，应该是企业缩小生产的原因。其他C和D两项在文中均没有提及。


 

**65.[****答案] D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**推理引申题**。

第四段首句提到，关于目前合并浪潮一定会带来利或弊的例子还不多见。第二句接着指出，但是目前数家石油公司的合并，是否会再次对竞争造成威胁却难以预料；100年前美国的标准石油联合公司（Standard Oil trust）被解散，就是因为当时人们担心它会对竞争构成威胁。由此可以推知D选项为正确答案。

从该段的电信业和汽车工业的例子可知，企业合并没有带来价格上涨或阻碍技术进步，因而消费者的利益也未受损害。所以A选项与本段最后一句话不符。文中举了世界通信公司的例子（本段第3句）只是说明合并并没有带来坏处，而不是B选项。C选项在文中根本未涉及。


 

**66.[****答案] B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**作者态度题**。

在第三段最后两句中，作者明确指出“所有这些（推动合并的因素）对消费者来说都是有益而无害。随着生产力的提高，世界的财富亦随之增长。”第四段作者举例说明合并没有给消费和技术进步带来危害。到了第五段，作者开始提醒人们要避免它带来的不利影响。可见，作者提到合并浪潮可能产生的正反两方面的影响，就事论事，并且列举大量数字和事实进行说明。所以作者的态度应该是客观的，因此B选项为正确答案。

知识点补充：作者在文中一般使用带有褒贬色彩的词汇（尤其是形容词和动词），或者引用专业和权威人士的话去表明自己的态度。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

​    ① International affiliates account for a fast-growing segment of production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment.

该句主干为International affiliates account for…，其中“that”引导的是一个定语从句，修饰“economies”。

知识点补充：“affiliates”指世界各地的分公司；“account for”意为“是……的原因”、“导致，引起”或“占……比例”；“economies”用的是复数形式，指的是各个国家经济领域的各行各业。

② I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower trade and investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable of meeting customers’ demands. 

该句主干是“I believe that”加上一个较长的宾语从句。从句中，主干为the most important forces…are the same that …，that引导一个定语从句，修饰前面的the same。冒号后的成分一般是起解释的作用，这里列举原因。

知识点补充：“forces behind”和“underlie”意思相同，都表达“造成…的原因”。

③ Yet it is hard to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to competition that were feared nearly a century ago in the US, when the Standard Oil trust was broken up. 

该句主干是“It is hard to imagine that...”。第一个that引导imagine的宾语从句。宾语从句中又含有一个that引导的定语从句，修饰“competition”，定语从句中包含一个由“when”引导的时间状语。Standard Oil trust指美国石油托拉斯，它像现在的微软公司因为有垄断之嫌而被迫解体。

佳句赏析：

① The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed.

该句运用暗喻的修辞手法，形象地使用wave一词描述全球企业兼并的大趋势。

② This phenomenon has created serious concerns over the role of smaller economic firms, of national businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world economy.

该句运用两层并列形式的结构，达到较强的语境效果。over the role和over the ultimate stability的并列是第一层，role后面的两个of是第二层并列。

 

**四、全文翻译**

**世界正在经历一场从未见过的巨大的并购浪潮。**（佳句①）这个浪潮从异常活跃的美国席卷到欧洲，并以不可比拟的威力影响到正在崛起的国家。这些国家的许多人看着这个浪潮，忧虑着：“企业合并的浪潮会不会产生一种无法控制的反竞争力量?”

无疑，大企业正在变得更大、更强。跨国公司在1982年只占有国际贸易不到20%的份额。目前，这个数字上升到25%，并且还在迅速上升。**在那些对外开放并欢迎外资的国家的经济中，国际分公司在国民生产中形成一个快速增长的部门。**（长难句①）例如，在阿根廷，经过90年代初的改革之后，跨国公司在200家大型企业的工业生产中从43%增加到几乎70%。**这个现象使得人们非常担忧小型企业，民族资本的作用，也使得人们对世界经济的最终稳定产生了忧虑。**（佳句②）

**我认为，推动这次巨大的并购浪潮的最主要的力量，也是推动全球化进程的力量，就是运输与通讯费用的降低，贸易与投资障碍的减少，以及市场的扩大和为满足市场需求的生产的扩大。**（长难句②）所有这些对消费者来说都有益而无害。随着生产力的提高，世界的财富也就增长了。

 目前这场合并浪潮的利与弊并无多少实例。**但是很难想象当今的几个石油公司的合并能够重新造成100年前美国标准石油公司被解散时人们担心它对竞争造成的威胁。**（长难句③）通讯公司的合并，如世界通讯公司，似乎没有给消费者带来更高的价格，或者滞缓了技术进步的速度。在汽车行业，合并也同样在增加，看看戴姆勒与克莱斯勒，雷诺与尼桑，但仿佛消费者并未受到伤害。

但是事实仍然是，合并运动必须受到严密监视。几星期以前，格林斯潘对银行业的大规模合并发出了警告。如果如此巨大的银行出现，谁来充当最终的借贷者，发挥监督、管理和运作的作用?当一个国家对破坏公平竞争的行为的处理过于严格时，跨国公司会不会把它们的产业从一个地方转到另一个地方?在事情将影响所有国家的情况下，一个国家是否应该独自担负起“保护竞争”的责任，如美国政府诉讼微软公司的案件?

**一、文章结构总体分析**

本文是一篇关于美国人追求简朴生活这一潮流的散文。作者以第一人称的笔调叙述了自身生活态度和方式的转变经历，进而谈及整个美国的情形及剖析这股潮流的成因。从写作特点来说是一篇夹叙夹议的文章，叙述部分（前三段）是一个引子，为后面的议论作铺垫。

前三段：作者通过对自己生活方式转变的总结，进而讲述当初辞职的初衷以及现在作者的生活，并总结自己生活变化带来的益处和感悟。

第四段：段首指出这种生活方式在美国成为一个潮流，并列举一些实例说明其普遍性。

本题考查考生对细节的理解，包括读懂每句话的含义，及弄清前因后果和事实。文章第一段第二句讲到，“一次工作的平级调动（a lateral move）伤害了我的自尊，阻碍了我在工作上的升迁，这促使我放弃了相对体面的（high profile）工作生涯”。可见，作者辞职是有外因的。B选项“作者因环境所迫而辞职”与该事实相符，是正确答案。

A选项与原文相矛盾。第一句说的是我辞去全职工作（quit my full time employment）使我成为国际时尚的一分子，而不是做全职工作。C选项错误地把“A lateral move”理解为放弃全职工作。lateral原意是“横向的”，这里指“平级之间的”。第一段末句提到，为了掩饰（cover）辞职的真正原因，我找了一个“想多花些时间和家人在一起”的借口，因此D选项是托词而不是事实。


 

**68.[****答案]** **B**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**事实细节题**。

本题仍然考查考生对细节的理解，要求考生从作者的经历去分析其生活态度前后的转变，关键在于把握第二段末句“transform from...into...”的结构。作者在第二段谈到，“经过约两年半的时间并发表了两部小说以后，我那被美国人称之为‘放慢生活节奏’的生活经历，却将我反复用的借口（指第一段最后一句掩饰辞职原因的话）转化为实实在在的事实。我已经从一个‘拥有一切’（having it all）生活哲学的积极倡导者（这是过去七年里Linda Kelsey一直在《她》杂志上鼓吹的生活方式），变成一个知足常乐（settle for a bit of everything）的女人”。可见B选项正确，因为她从这次生活经历中有了重新认识，形成了新的人生观。

从文章内容可知，“放慢生活节奏”并不是作者原有的梦想，而是当初迫不得已的选择，只是后来她意外发现自己喜欢上了这种生活方式，所以A选项不对。C选项是最初的平级调动带来的结果，而非放慢生活节奏的结果。D选项恰恰与文中事实相反，实际结果是抛弃而非接受。


 

**69. [****答案]** **C**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**词义题**。

本题考查考生通过上下文猜测词义的能力。考生关键要通过对第三段首句复杂的句子结构的分析（见长难句③），知道“Juggling one’s life”即是“downshifting”的反面。在这个句子中，作者把“Juggling one’s life”和“downshifting”对立起来进行比较，因此前者应该指与“放慢生活节奏”相反的“工作压力大、忙忙碌碌的生活”。下文第二句话中的四个并列名词短语“12-hour working days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain of office politics and the limitations of being a parent on ‘quality time’”（一天工作12小时、每件事情都有最后的期限、公务上争权夺利带来的可怕压力以及因为时间有限连做母亲也得“高效率”）对该短语进行了进一步解释。显然只有C选项是对这些特征的高度概括。注意第四段首句提到的A选项、第二段提到的B选项和第四段第二句谈到的D选项的内容都是“downshifting”的特征。

词汇补充：politics原意多指“政治事件、政治生活、政治活动”，也可指“一个群体或组织内部为争夺权利和利益的斗争”如：Church politics 教会的明争暗斗。


 

**70.[****答案] D**

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：因果关系题。本题考查考生理解具体细节的能力。第五段首句指出，美国的这一趋势开始是对经济衰退的一种反映（a reaction to the economic decline），所以D选项“经济形势”是这种生活方式产生的原因。其它三个选项在文中都未提及。

 

**三、文章长难句分析与佳句赏析**

长难句分析：

①A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my professional progress prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of a disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming “I wanted to spend more time with my family”. 

该句是由although连接含转折语气的两个分句：A lateral move prompted me to abandon my career和I covered my exit。前一分句的主语A lateral move由that引导的定语从句修饰；后一个分句中用了in the manner of（以…的方式）和by claiming两个结构做谓语covered的方式状语。

②I have been transformed from a passionate advocate of the philosophy of “having it all”, preached by Linda Kelsey for the past seven years in the pages of She magazine, into a woman who is happy to settle for a bit of everything. 

该句子的特点是定语修饰成分较多。句子主干是I have been transformed from a advocate... into a woman...，advocate后接of短语做定语，woman后接who引导的定语从句做定语。preached by...分词结构用做philosophy的定语。having it all指“拥有一切”，是一种享乐主义；settle for a bit of everything中的settle意为“安定、定局”，整个短语指“什么都只要一点”，即“很容易满足”。

③I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the editorship of *She* after a build-up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of “juggling your life”, and making the alternative move into “downshifting” brings with it far greater rewards than financial success and social status. 

该句子结构较复杂，有多重结构。第一重是主句的主干I have discovered ... that ...，that引导宾语从句：abandoning...and making…brings with it far greater rewards，其中主语由并列的动名词结构构成；第二重结构是：that前的插入语是个省略倒装句，as代替主句的谓语discover，其正常顺序应是perhaps Kelsey will discover after...；that后宾语从句中含有一个比较结构…brings greater rewards than…。Juggling one’s life中“juggle”原意为“耍把戏”，短语里借用它暗含的“忙个不停”的意思，表示“忙忙碌碌地生活”。

④While in America the trend started as a reaction to the economic decline—after the mass redundancies caused by downsizing in the late-80s—and is still linked to the politics of thrift, in Britain, at least among the middle class downshifters of my acquaintance, we have different reasons for seeking to simplify our lives.

该句子的特点是while引导两个分句形成对照，前一分句的主干是in America the trend started as a reaction and is still linked to the politics；后一分句的主干是in Britain we have different reasons；破折号之间的插入语是前一分句的时间状语；逗号间的插入语at least among…是后一分句的状语。

⑤For the women of my generation who were urged to keep juggling through the ’80s, downshifting in the mid-90s is not so much a search for the mythical good life—growing your own organic vegetables, and risking turning into one—as a personal recognition of your limitations.

该句子的主干中含有一个具有比较意义的结构downshifting is **not so much** a search...**as** a personal recognition（**与其说**是追求，**不如**说是个人认识）。句首介词结构For the women…做句子的状语，表示“对于…来说”，两个破折号之间的两个并列的动名词短语growing…and risking…是对前面名词the mythical good life的解释。

佳句赏析：

①When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might become a part of a new international trend. 

“When...it never occurred to me that...”结构可以表达在过去某个时间里没法预料到后来要发生的事情。如：Nobody can really expect his future. When Steven Doglas worked as a salesman in a shoes-shop of a small town, it never occurred to him that he might become a superstar three years later.

②My experiment in what the Americans term “downshifting” has turned my tired excuse into an absolute reality.

该句子中tired excuse使用了英语中的一种修辞格，叫“转移形容词”，即形容词形式上修饰事物，实际上用来修饰人所具有的某种品质、性质或状况。这种修辞格的使用使句子具有修辞效果，简洁而地道。类似的用法有：sleepless night（不眠之夜），wise decision（明智的决定），respectful distance（敬而远之），word by painful word（一字一字吃力地）smiling words（微笑着交谈）。句子中tired excuse指的是作者声称“累了想陪陪家人”来作为辞职的借口。

 

**四、全文翻译**

**当我决定辞去自己的全日制工作时决没有想到，自己竟成了一种新的国际性潮流的一分子**（佳句①）**。一次平级的人事调动伤了我的自尊心，并阻断了我的事业发展，这促使我放弃自己地位较高的职业，然而，我却像面子扫尽的政府部长那样，掩饰地说“我想与家人更多地呆在一起”**（长难句①）。

奇怪的是，大约两年半的时间我写完两部小说后，**我这个被美国人称为“放慢生活节奏”的尝试，却使我所谓的累了的借口变成了现实**（佳句②）**。我已从一个“获得一切”哲学（琳达·凯茜过去七年中在《她》这本杂志所宣扬的）的狂热支持者，变成了一个乐于接受任何东西只要一丁点的女人**（长难句②）**。**

**我已经发现（由于压力过大，凯茜已多次公开宣称要辞去《她》杂志编辑的职务，在这之后她也许会有同样发现），放弃“忙忙碌碌”的生活哲学，转而过一种“放慢生活节奏”的生活所带来的回报，比金钱和社会地位更有价值**（长难句③）**。**什么也说服不了我回到过去那种凯尔茜所宣扬的、我也曾自得其乐的生活中去：每天12小时的工作日，压得人喘不过气来的最后期限，可怕而紧张的办公室里的争权夺利，以及在“最佳时期”做父母受到限制。

在美国，摆脱忙碌，转而过一种简单、不太物质化的生活已成明确趋势。具有讽刺意味的是，“放慢生活节奏”——在美国也称“自愿简单化”——甚至孕育了一个崭新的、可称之为反消费主义的新领域。对于那些想过简单生活的人来说，有许多很畅销的帮你轻松生活的自助书籍；有各种像《守财奴简报》这样的简讯，给美国人提供成千上万条有用的点子，从回收保鲜膜到自制肥皂；甚至还有一些帮助团体，帮助有些人按90年代中期逃避社会现实的人的生活方式去生活。

**在美国，这种趋势一开始是对经济衰落所做出的一种反应——出现于80年代后期缩小经济规模所引起的大量人员冗余之后——现在这种趋势仍被认为与节俭政治有关联；而在英国，至少在我所认识的愿意简化生活的中产阶级中，却有着不同的缘由去寻求使自己的生活简单化**（长难句④）**。**

**对我们这一代女性来说，整个80年代我们曾被迫忙碌地生活，90年代中期的简化生活与其说是寻求神话般的好生活——自己种有机蔬菜以及冒险成为像有机蔬菜一样简单淳朴的人——倒不如说我们都认识了自身的局限**（长难句⑤）**。**

 

**Section IV: English-Chinese Translation (15 points)**

 

**一、试题总体分析**

这篇文章主要展望了科学技术给人类未来生活可能带来的各种变化，未来学家对科学突破性进展日期的预测，以及某些技术进步可能带来的社会问题。

2001年度翻译试题难度适中，考点涉及了词义确定、非谓语结构以及从句的翻译。就此，考生可以总结出，词义确定和句子结构是翻译必考的项目。词义确定要求考生根据上下文和搭配的要求，确定某个特定词在本句中的意思以及翻译后选择的汉语表达，而这个意思往往不是考生在平时记忆的单词词义，可能是某个偏僻的词义、引伸义，甚至在该上下文中才有的、没有在词典中确定下来的意思。因此特别提醒考生不要字对字地翻译，而要在上下文中确定具体单词的意思，正如一句话说得好：“There is no meaning except in the context.”（只有在上下文中才有词义）。

 

**二、试题具体解析**

（71）There will be television chat shows hosted by robots, and cars with pollution monitors that will disable them when they offend.

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**定语从句的翻译、过去分词做定语、词义确定**。

句子的主干是there be 句型的将来时，译成“将会出现……，将有……”。hosted by robots是过去分词作后置定语修饰chat shows，由于不太长，翻译时可以前置做定语。pollution monitors（污染监控器）后面接的定语从句that will disable...offend并不是起修饰限定作用，翻译时不能把它前置做定语，此从句实际是说 pollution monitors 的功能，译时可独立成句。定语从句中包含一个when 引导的时间状语从句。

词汇：chat shows即是近年来在我国也广为流行的电视谈话节目；host做名词为“（男）主持人”，做动词是“主持”；offend本意是“冒犯，侵犯”，在这里根据上下文，意思应当是“违规”，进而可译为（汽车）“污染超标”；disable的意思也应当根据上下文确定为“使（汽车）无法运转”。

译文：届时，将会出现由机器人主持的电视谈话节目和装有污染监控器的汽车。一旦这些汽车排污超标（违规），监控器就会使其停驶。

（72）Children will play with dolls equipped with personality chips, computers with in-built personalities will be regarded as workmates rather than tools, relaxation will be in front of smell television, and digital age will have arrived.

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**意译、介词结构作后置定语、rather than的译法。**

整个句子实际上由四个分句并列组成，由逗号和and 连接，但是最后一句从意思上看实际是一句总结性的话。第一分句中，equipped with personality chips是过去分词做定语修饰dolls；第二句是一个被动语态，其中主要结构为be regarded as … rather than …，意思为“被看作是……而不是……”，该句中with in-built personalities这一介词结构作computers的后置定语；第三句如果直译成“休闲将在气味电视机前面”不太贴切，尤其作为书面语不合适，考生可以加入“休闲”这一动作的发出者，将该句译成：人们将在气味电视机前休闲，或译成：休闲将在气味电视机前面进行；第四句中，考生需要注意时态为将来完成时。

词汇：computers后的with结构是“带有、具有”的意思；in-built意为“内在的，内置的”，rather than表示否定，此结构翻译题中就已经数次出现。

译文：儿童将与装有个性化芯片的玩具娃娃玩耍，具有个性内置的计算机将被视为工作伙伴而不是工具，人们将在气味电视机前休闲，届时数字化时代就要来到了。

（73）Pearson has pieced together the work of hundreds of researchers around the world to produce a unique millennium technology calendar that gives the latest dates when we can expect hundreds of key breakthroughs and discoveries to take place.

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**多重复合句的译法**。

该句子是复杂的复合句，其结构可以分三层。第一层是句子主语是Pearson has pieced together the work of hundreds of researchers … to …，不定式引导目的状语，第二层在目的状语中，宾语calendar后有that引导的定语从句，第三层结构为that引导的定语从句中，宾语the latest dates后又有一个when引导的定语从句，注意不要误以为时状语从句。这样的三层复合结构形成了环环相套的定语从句链，关键在于考生需要把这个链条打断，也就是进行断句，考生可以在that处断句。

词汇：piece together意为“汇集”；the latest dates意为“最近的日期”；key breakthroughs意为“重大突破”。

译文：皮尔森汇集世界各地数百位研究人员的成果，编制了一个独特的新技术千年历，它列出了人们有望看到数百项重大突破和发现的最迟日期。

（74）But that, Pearson points out, is only the start of man-machine integration: “It will be the beginning of the long process of integration that will ultimately lead to a fully electronic human before the end of the next century. ”

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**定语从句**。

Pearson points out属插入语成分，主句为主表结构that is the start，它实际上也是point out 的宾语内容。主语that 是代词，指前两句中提到的电脑与人之间连接的突破。引号中的是Pearson所说的话。it 指代紧跟它的integration（一体化）。that will ultimately...century是修饰the process of integration 的定语从句，由于定语太长，不适宜在中文中做前置定语，只能另起一句，用重复先行词的办法，或把定语从句译作并列句。

译文：皮尔森指出，这个突破仅仅是人机一体化的开始：“它是人机一体化漫长之路的第一步，最终会使人们在下世纪末之前就研制出完全电子化的仿真人。”

（75）And home appliances will also become so smart that controlling and operating them will result in the breakout of a new psychological disorder—kitchen rage. 

**[****解析]** 本题考核的知识点是：**so … that结构、词义确定**。

这个句子的主干是home appliances will become so...that...，“so … that …”结构的意思是“如此……以至……”。that 后接的是结果状语从句，从句的主语是controlling and operating them；them指的是主语home appliances；从句的谓语是will result in，breakout of...是in的介词宾语。此处的破折号起解释作用，解释a new psychological disorder的内容。

词汇：smart 意为“巧妙的，（人）聪明的”，但是在这里需要结合上下文理解为“智能化的”；breakout 一般译为“爆发”，但是与心理疾病或心理紊乱（a psychological disorder）搭配不合适，所以意译为“引起，引发”；同理kitchen rage亦不可直译为“厨房暴怒”，尽量与心理疾病的用词挂钩，译为“厨房狂躁症”。

译文：家用电器将会变得如此智能化，以至于控制和操作它们会引发一种新的心理疾病——厨房狂躁症。

 

**三、参考译文**

在未来不到三十年的时间里，特列克星号的全息舱面就会成为现实。大脑神经系统和计算机之间的直接连接还会创造出全方位感受虚拟环境，使电影《全部回忆》中展示的虚拟假期成为可能。

（71）**届时，将会出现由机器人主持的电视谈话节目和装有污染监控器的汽车。一旦这些汽车排污超标（违规），监控器就会使其停驶。（72）儿童将与装有个性化芯片的玩具娃娃玩耍，具有个性内置的计算机将被视为工作伙伴而不是工具，人们将在气味电视机前休闲，届时数字化时代就要来到了。**

依BT的未来学家亚恩·皮尔森做出的预见，这些都属于新世纪头几十年发展计划之列，届时，超级计算机将急剧加速各个生活领域的发展。

（73）**皮尔森汇集世界各地数百位研究人员的成果，编制了一个独特的新技术千年历，它列出了人们有望看到数百项重大突破和发现的最迟日期。**一些最大的进展将在医学领城，包括人预期寿命的延长和数十种人造器官，这些将在现在到2024年之间陆续实现。

皮尔森还预言，在计算机与人的连接上会有一个重大突破。他说：“通过直接与我们的神经系统相连，计算机可以知道我们的感觉，并且，我们希望，它可以模仿感觉，这样，我们就能够发展全方位感知环境，就像电影《全部回忆》中的虚拟假期或特列克星号上的全息舱面。”（74）**但皮尔森指出，这个突破仅仅是人机一体化的开始：“它是人机一体化漫长之路的第一步，最终会使人们在下世纪末之前就研制出完全电子化的仿真人。”**

通过研究，皮尔逊能够预言大多数突破的发生时间。然而，对于何时能够进行超光速旅行，何时人类克隆技术能够得以完善，何时可以进行时间旅行，却依然没有预见。但他的确预见技术进步引起的社会问题。比如，到2010年，住宅区附近监视器数量的剧增将引发问题；仿真机器人意味着人类可能无法区分同类朋友和这些机器人伙伴。（75）**家用电器将会变得如此智能化，以至于控制和操作它们会引发一种新的心理疾病——厨房狂躁症。**

 

**Section V: Writing (20 points)**

**一、审题谋篇**

本题命题形式为漫画加提纲式写作。

提纲有三点要求：（1）描述画面的寓意，此处考生要注意symbolic meaning（比喻义）；(2)举一个具体的例子对主题加以论证；(3)对于如何献爱心给出你的建议。

首先，审题时考生要抓住关键词。漫画加提纲式写作中，漫画中的字，特别是漫画的题目可谓是一字千金，千万不可放过。本题的漫画中出现“爱心是一盏灯，在越黑暗的地方越明亮”一句话，该句最突出的词是“爱心”，后半句话指出最需要爱心的环境——“黑暗中”，也就是说别人有困难的地方。因此漫画旨在提倡为需要帮助的人或地方献出爱心。

其次，考生需要看清题目要求。要求指出文章应点明漫画所示内涵，并应举出具体事例，在此前提下提出自己对献爱心的建议。由此可见，文章中既要联系社会举例，又要给出自己的评论，所以命题所测试的中心内容为描述加议论。

考生可以在坚守三段论基础上采用叙议结合的方法：第一段需围绕图画展开，将图画中所有信息描述清楚，点出漫画所示内涵。第二段要针对主题举具体的例子，由本题中心可知，举的例子应体现两要素：“爱心”和“需要”。第三段应在联系实际，突出中心的基础上，提出具体建议。

 

**二、参考范文**

​    As can be seen from this **vivid** picture, like a light, love means much more to those who are **in great difficulty** than to those who live **in comforts**. Love, as **illustrated** in the picture，is just like the oil lamp，which certainly shines brighter in the dark. In other words，**the darker** the place is，**the more precious** the light will be. Love is somewhat the same: it is most needed by those who are in urgent need of help and considered most **precious** in most difficult situations.  Therefore, as people living in the modern society, we all should **contribute** our love to those needy people.

​    I can **exemplify** this conclusion with the Poverty Alleviation Project. It is known to all that the Chinese government has been calling for people **participating** **in** the project. Obviously, the expression of love can be best **demonstrated** by helping the poor in some backward regions.  Therefore, many college students choose to work in these regions **upon graduation**. **It is** in these places **that** they are most needed and their knowledge can be made best use of.  

  The best way to show our love，in my opinion，is to **follow the above mentioned example**, giving love to the people during the hours of darkness. So when we see someone in difficulty or in distress，don’t hesitate to **offer our hands**. I believe the relationship between people will be more **harmonious** and our society will be a better place for us to live in. Let’s do as a famous saying goes：**Ask not what others can do for you; ask what you can do for others**. 

 

**三、范文点评**

文章结构：

本文思路清晰，重点突出。首段开篇点题，接着，考生清晰地阐述了灯光的象征意义，段尾再次概括全文的主题，段落几个部分相互呼应。第二段中，考生举出一个既有深度（崇高性），又有广度（社会性）的例子——扶贫工程，并在段尾总结论证论点：要在别人困难的时候献爱心。第三段，作者提出具体建议，最后提出号召，并以流行语点睛。

语言亮点：

\1. vivid：形象的，生动的。副词为vividly。

\2. in great difficulty和in comforts：两个介词结构意思相反，形成对仗。

\3. illustrate：（用插图或图画）说明，阐明。例如：The cartoon illustrates a profound principle in life.（这幅画揭示了一个深刻的人生哲理）

\4. the darker …the more precious…：这里使用的是the more … the more …结构，例如：The faster our country’s industry develops, the more efforts we should spare in protecting the environment.（工业发展越快，我们越应该花精力保护环境）。

\5. precious：珍贵的，宝贵的。如：Time is precious.（时间很宝贵）。

\6. contribute：对…做贡献，名词形式是contribution，如：make a contribution。

\7. exemplify：用例子说明，例证。例如：This story exemplifies what I just said.（这个故事正好说明了我刚才说的话）。类似用法有：illustrate, serve as an example。

\8. participate in：参加，类似的用法有：take part, join in, partake, get involved。

\9. demonstrate：表现，表明，证明。例如：This cartoon demonstrates a widespread phenomenon in society.（这幅画表现了社会上的一个普遍现象）。

\10. upon graduation：upon后加名词，可表示“…的时候”。如：Upon seeing their child make achievements, the parents are always as joyful as anything.（当看到自己的孩子取得成绩，父母总是高兴得不得了）

\11. It is…that（who）…：常引导结构强调句，it is后接句子中被强调的部分，它可以是状语、主语、宾语或宾与补足语，但不可以是表语、谓语动词和让步状语从句或对比状语从句。若强调的是人，用关系代词who，其它都用that。如：It is with the development of technology and population growth, the amount and range of materials used has increased at an alarming rate.（正是随着技术的发展和人口的增长，使用材料的数量和范围也都在以惊人的速度增长）。在写作中让句型保持多样化可以给文章增加不少色彩和可读性，强调句就是一个很好的选择，它使句子简洁而有力度。

\12. follow the above mentioned example：follow example表示“模仿…”；above mentioned的意思是“上面提及的”。

\13. offer our hands：“帮助”，类似的表达有：help out, extend a hand, lend a hand, give assistance。

\14. harmonious：“和睦的”，该词常形容family或relations。

\15. Ask not what others can do for you; ask what you can do for others：不要问别人能为你做什么，而问你能为别人做什么。该句来自于美国总统肯尼迪的名言：“Ask not what your nation can do for you; ask what you can do for your nation.”（不要问你的国家能为你做什么，而要问你能为你的国家做什么）。能够在作文中恰当地用上名言的考生恐怕不会太多，但是一旦用上就会引起阅卷老师的注意，得高分的可能性也就越大。因此考生平时可注意加强这方面的准备。如：The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for circumstances they want, and if they cannot find them, make them.（在这个世界上取得成功的人，都努力去寻找他们想要的机会，如果找不到时，他们就自己创造机会。——英国著名作家萧伯纳）

 

**四、写作误区**

篇章结构误区：

首先，考生应当看清题目要求。一看到油灯，有的考生就按照固定思维，想当然地认为文章中心是赞扬“春蚕到死丝方尽，蜡炬成灰泪始干”的人民教师，结果写成了一篇教师颂。指导语中虽说明了“Everyone has his/her own understanding of love”，但图画上已经明确给出了主题：“爱心是一盏灯，在越黑暗的地方越明亮”，也就是说爱心在最需要它的地方显得最有价值。而有的考生花了大量笔墨赞美爱，包括爱情、友情、亲情等，论述“love is noblest feeling”，有的考生则联想到社会上的黑暗面，对缺乏“爱心”的人进行一番批判。以上都是由于审题不慎而造成的跑题。其次作文要求中规定要举一个例子说明问题。因此，考生所举的例子应当具体并且具有代表性。不可泛泛而谈，也不可虚构一些不切实际的例子。本文要想写得有深度，很大程度上由例子的深度和广度决定。因此，要想得高分，例子至关重要，应具有广阔的社会性，如“希望工程”、“长江抗洪”、“扶贫计划”、帮助下岗职工再就业等等。

语言表达错误： 

①词性错误：

Our world will bright if everyone shows love to others.（Our world will *become bright* if everyone shows love to others.）

②搭配不当：

Although the light is weak, it plays a great effect which will make people more firmly than before.（Although the light is weak, it *has* a great effect which will make people more *firm* than before.）

③代词不一致：         

When every one devotes some love to the world, you will find the world is brighter and more beautiful.（When every one *gives his share of* love to the world, *he* will find the world is brighter and more beautiful.）

④介词错误：

I was greatly worried my future life.（I was greatly worried *abou*t my future life.）

⑤非谓语结构错误：

The best way show love is to help those need help in their life.（The best way *to show* love is to help those *needing / who need* help in their life.）

⑥累赘：

For those people who still live very poor lives, the help from other people can give them light and hope to improve their lives.（Poor people can get light and hope from others’ help to improve their lives.）

⑦综合性错误：

Even if the government gives more money to help children in poor areas, the rate of them are helped is still very low.（Even if the government *appropriates* more money to help children in poor areas, the *number* of *those who* *can be* helped is still very *small*.

**Text 1**

A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly handled, it may become a driving force. When the United States entered just such a glowing period after the end of the Second World War, it had a market eight times larger than any competitor, giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale. Its scientists were the world’s best, its workers the most skilled. America and Americans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the Europeans and Asians whose economies the war had destroyed.

It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other countries grew richer. Just as inevitably, the retreat from predominance proved painful. By the mid-1980s Americans had found themselves at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. Some huge American industries, such as consumer electronics, had shrunk or vanished in the face of foreign competition. By 1987 there was only one American television maker left, Zenith. (Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South Korea’s LG Electronics in July.) Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into the domestic market. America’s machine-tool industry was on the ropes. For a while it looked as though the making of semiconductors, which America had invented and which sat at the heart of the new computer age, was going to be the next casualty.

All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking prosperity for granted. They began to believe that their way of doing business was failing, and that their incomes would therefore shortly begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after another into the causes of America’s industrial decline. Their sometimes sensational findings were filled with warnings about the growing competition from overseas.

How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on five years of solid growth while Japan has been struggling. Few Americans attribute this solely to such obvious causes as a devalued dollar or the turning of the business cycle. Self-doubt has yielded to blind pride. “American industry has changed its structure, has gone on a diet, has learnt to be more quick-witted,” according to Richard Cavanagh, executive dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “It makes me proud to be an American just to see how our businesses are improving their productivity,” says Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. And William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School believes that people will look back on this period as “a golden age of business management in the United States.”

\51.   The U.S. achieved its predominance after World War II because ________.

[A] it had made painstaking efforts towards this goal

[B] its domestic market was eight times larger than before

[C] the war had destroyed the economies of most potential competitors（C）

[D] the unparalleled size of its workforce had given an impetus to its economy

\52.   The loss of U.S. predominance in the world economy in the 1980s is manifested in the fact that the American ________.

[A] TV industry had withdrawn to its domestic market

[B] semiconductor industry had been taken over by foreign enterprises

[C] machine-tool industry had collapsed after suicidal actions（D）

[D] auto industry had lost part of its domestic market

\53.   What can be inferred from the passage?

[A] It is human nature to shift between self-doubt and blind pride.

[B] Intense competition may contribute to economic progress.

[C] The revival of the economy depends on international cooperation.（B）

[D] A long history of success may pave the way for further development.

\54.   The author seems to believe the revival of the U.S. economy in the 1990s can be attributed to the ________.

Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males born for every 100 females, but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice as many women as men. But the great universal of male mortality is being changed. Now, boy babies survive almost as well as girls do. This means that, for the first time, there will be an excess of boys in those crucial years when they are searching for a mate. More important, another chance for natural selection has been removed. Fifty years ago, the chance of a baby (particularly a boy baby) surviving depended on its weight. A kilogram too light or too heavy meant almost certain death. Today it makes almost no difference. Since much of the variation is due to genes, one more agent of evolution has gone.

There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but have fewer children. Few people are as fertile as in the past. Except in some religious communities, very few women have 15 children. Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death, has become average. Most of us have roughly the same number of offspring. Again, differences between people and the opportunity for natural selection to take advantage of it have diminished. India shows what is happening. The country offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty for the remaining tribal peoples. The grand mediocrity of today -- everyone being the same in survival and number of offspring -- means that natural selection has lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes.

For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived. Strangely, it has involved little physical change. No other species fills so many places in nature. But in the pass 100,000 years -- even the pass 100 years -- our lives have been transformed but our bodies have not. We did not evolve, because machines and society did it for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe those ignorant of evolution: they “look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension.” No doubt we will remember a 20th century way of life beyond comprehension for its ugliness. But however amazed our descendants may be at how far from Utopia we were, they will look just like us.

\55.   What used to be the danger in being a man according to the first paragraph?

[A] A lack of mates.

[B] A fierce competition.

[C] A lower survival rate.（C）

[D] A defective gene.

\56.   What does the example of India illustrate?

[A] Wealthy people tend to have fewer children than poor people.

[B] Natural selection hardly works among the rich and the poor.

[C] The middle class population is 80% smaller than that of the tribes.（B）

[D] India is one of the countries with a very high birth rate.

\57.   The author argues that our bodies have stopped evolving because ________.

[A] life has been improved by technological advance

[B] the number of female babies has been declining

[C] our species has reached the highest stage of evolution（A）

[D] the difference between wealth and poverty is disappearing

\58.   Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?

[A] Sex Ratio Changes in Human Evolution

[B] Ways of Continuing Man’s Evolution

[C] The Evolutionary Future of Nature（D）

[D] Human Evolution Going Nowhere

When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its advocates are aiming at, for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles may seem today, it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. With regard to Futurist poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist poetry may be -- even admitting that the theory on which it is based may be right -- it can hardly be classed as Literature.

This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for a century, past conditions of life have been conditionally speeding up, till now we live in a world of noise and violence and speed. Consequently, our feelings, thoughts and emotions have undergone a corresponding change. This speeding up of life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression. We must speed up our literature too, if we want to interpret modern stress. We must pour out a large stream of essential words, unhampered by stops, or qualifying adjectives, or finite verbs. Instead of describing sounds we must make up words that imitate them; we must use many sizes of type and different colored inks on the same page, and shorten or lengthen words at will.

Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little upsetting to read in the explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a bridge off which they both fall into the river -- and then to find that the line consists of the noise of their falling and the weights of the officers: “Pluff! Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five kilograms.”

This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be classed as Literature. All the same, no thinking man can refuse to accept their first proposition: that a great change in our emotional life calls for a change of expression. The whole question is really this: have we essentially changed?

\59.   This passage is mainly ________.

[A] a survey of new approaches to art

[B] a review of Futurist poetry

[C] about merits of the Futurist movement（B）

[D] about laws and requirements of literature

\60.   When a novel literary idea appears, people should try to ________.

[A] determine its purposes

[B] ignore its flaws

[C] follow the new fashions（A）

[D] accept the principles

\61.   Futurists claim that we must ________.

[A] increase the production of literature

[B] use poetry to relieve modern stress

[C] develop new modes of expression（C）

[D] avoid using adjectives and verbs

\62.   The author believes that Futurist poetry is ________.

[A] based on reasonable principles

[B] new and acceptable to ordinary people

[C] indicative of basic change in human nature（D）

[D] more of a transient phenomenon than literature

Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social harmony are the envy of the United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are seeing a decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were hardworking and saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don’t know where they should go next.

The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job market have limited the opportunities of teenagers who are already questioning the heavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan’s rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs. In a recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese students were fully satisfied with school life, compared with 67.2 percent of students in the United States. In addition, far more Japanese workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs than did their counterparts in the 10 other countries surveyed.

While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression. “Those things that do not show up in the test scores -- personality, ability, courage or humanity -- are completely ignored,” says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s education committee. “Frustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild.” Last year Japan experienced 2,125 incidents of school violence, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry, many conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis on moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World War II had weakened the “Japanese morality of respect for parents.”

But that may have more to do with Japanese life-styles. “In Japan,” says educator Yoko Muro, “it’s never a question of whether you enjoy your job and your life, but only how much you can endure.” With economic growth has come centralization; fully 76 percent of Japan’s 119 million citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have been abandoned in favor of isolated, two-generation households. Urban Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work) and crowded living conditions, but as the old group and family values weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that of the United States, has increased by more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by nearly one-quarter.

\63.   In the Westerner’s eyes, the postwar Japan was ________.

[A] under aimless development

[B] a positive example

[C] a rival to the West（B）

[D] on the decline

\64.   According to the author, what may chiefly be responsible for the moral decline of Japanese society?

[A] Women’s participation in social activities is limited.

[B] More workers are dissatisfied with their jobs.

[C] Excessive emphasis has been placed on the basics.（D）

[D] The life-style has been influenced by Western values.

\65.   Which of the following is true according to the author?

[A] Japanese education is praised for helping the young climb the social ladder.

[B] Japanese education is characterized by mechanical learning as well as creativity.

[C] More stress should be placed on the cultivation of creativity.（C）

[D] Dropping out leads to frustration against test taking.

\66.   The change in Japanese life-style is revealed in the fact that ________.

[A] the young are less tolerant of discomforts in life

[B] the divorce rate in Japan exceeds that in the U.S.

[C] the Japanese endure more than ever before（A）

[D] the Japanese appreciate their present life

**Text 5**

If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition -- wealth, distinction, control over one’s destiny -- must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition’s behalf. If the tradition of ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it especially must be highly regarded by people who are themselves admired, the educated not least among them. In an odd way, however, it is the educated who have claimed to have given up on ambition as an ideal. What is odd is that they have perhaps most benefited from ambition -- if not always their own then that of their parents and grandparents. There is heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn door after the horses have escaped -- with the educated themselves riding on them.

Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly. Summer homes, European travel, BMWs -- the locations, place names and name brands may change, but such items do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago. What has happened is that people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily and openly as once they could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and vulgar. Instead, we are treated to fine hypocritical spectacles, which now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic of American materialism with a Southampton summer home; the publisher of radical books who takes his meals in three-star restaurants; the journalist advocating participatory democracy in all phases of life, whose own children are enrolled in private schools. For such people and many more perhaps not so exceptional, the proper formulation is, “Succeed at all costs but avoid appearing ambitious.”

The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; its public defenders are few and unimpressive, where they are not extremely unattractive. As a result, the support for ambition as a healthy impulse, a quality to be admired and fixed in the mind of the young, is probably lower than it has ever been in the United States. This does not mean that ambition is at an end, that people no longer feel its stirrings and promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is less openly professed. Consequences follow from this, of course, some of which are that ambition is driven underground, or made sly. Such, then, is the way things stand: on the left angry critics, on the right stupid supporters, and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to get on in life.

\67.   It is generally believed that ambition may be well regarded if ________.

[A] its returns well compensate for the sacrifices

[B] it is rewarded with money, fame and power

[C] its goals are spiritual rather than material（A）

[D] it is shared by the rich and the famous

\68.   The last sentence of the first paragraph most probably implies that it is ________.

[A] customary of the educated to discard ambition in words

[B] too late to check ambition once it has been let out

[C] dishonest to deny ambition after the fulfillment of the goal（C）

[D] impractical for the educated to enjoy benefits from ambition

\69.   Some people do not openly admit they have ambition because ________.

[A] they think of it as immoral

[B] their pursuits are not fame or wealth

[C] ambition is not closely related to material benefits（D）

[D] they do not want to appear greedy and contemptible

\70.   From the last paragraph the conclusion can be drawn that ambition should be maintained ________.

[A] secretly and vigorously

[B] openly and enthusiastically

[C] easily and momentarily（B）

[D] verbally and spiritually

Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that the welfare of their people depends largely on the economic strength and wealth of the community. 71) Under modern conditions, this requires varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of specialized scientists such as economists and operational research experts. 72) Furthermore, it is obvious that the strength of a country’s economy is directly bound up with the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that this in turn rests upon the efforts of scientists and technologists of all kinds. It also means that governments are increasingly compelled to interfere in these sectors in order to step up production and ensure that it is utilized to the best advantage. For example, they may encourage research in various ways, including the setting up of their own research centers; they may alter the structure of education, or interfere in order to reduce the wastage of natural resources or tap resources hitherto unexploited; or they may cooperate directly in the growing number of international projects related to science, economics and industry. In any case, all such interventions are heavily dependent on scientific advice and also scientific and technological manpower of all kinds.

73) Owing to the remarkable development in mass-communications, people everywhere are feeling new wants and are being exposed to new customs and ideas, while governments are often forced to introduce still further innovations for the reasons given above. At the same time, the normal rate of social change throughout the world is taking place at a vastly accelerated speed compared with the past. For example, 74) in the early industrialized countries of Europe the process of industrialization -- with all the far-reaching changes in social patterns that followed -- was spread over nearly a century, whereas nowadays a developing nation may undergo the same process in a decade or so. All this has the effect of building up unusual pressures and tensions within the community and consequently presents serious problems for the governments concerned. 75) Additional social stresses may also occur because of the population explosion or problems arising from mass migration movements -- themselves made relatively easy nowadays by modern means of transport. As a result of all these factors, governments are becoming increasingly dependent on biologists and social scientists for planning the appropriate programs and putting them into effect.

**Part II: Cloze Test (10 points)**

 

**一、文章总体分析**

本文是一篇短小的论证性文章，其主题是强调农民储存余粮的必要性。

文章①句提出论点：农民想成功，就必须努力保持消费和生产之间有较大的差距。②句对①句进行具体的解释：即他必须存储大量的粮食。③④⑤从正面论述储存余粮的必要性：③句总说可以养家糊口；④⑤句具体说可以留作播种、应对恶劣天气影响及作为商品卖掉以满足农业再生产等需要。⑥⑦⑧句论述没有余粮的危害:不能自给自足，从反面论证储存余粮的必要性。

 

**二、试题具体解析**

41.[A] other than不同于，除了……         [B] as well as也，又（表示附加）

[C] instead of而不是……（表选择）     [D] more than比……更多（表比较）

本题考核的知识点是：逻辑关系。正确率：72%

**［快速解题］** 文章首句的含义是：一个农民要想成功，就必须努力保持其消费和生产之间较大的差距。接着文章提到了两种正好相反的做法，一种是store a large quantity of grain（存储大量的粮食），另一种是consuming all his grain immediately（立即把他所有的粮食都消费完）。显然前一种做法是农民可以成功的做法，因此空格处需要一个词语来否定后面部分，而且其后能跟现在分词。选项中，只有介词短语instead of符合要求，意为“他必须存储大量的粮食而不是立即把所有的粮食都消耗完”。

**［篇章分析］**①句为文章主旨句，核心内容是“保持消费和生产之间的差距”。②句承接①句，具体阐述如何保持这个差距：储存大量的粮食。

**［空格设置］**  instead of是连接性介词，体现上下文语义上的逻辑关系。instead of表选择关系，意为“代替，作为……的替换，而不是…”，在两种做法中肯定前者，否定后者。如：I will stay at home instead of going out.我将待在家里，不出门。其他连接性介词还包括because of（因为），despite（尽管），besides（除了）等。

**［干扰项设置］** 其他项的短语都可用于连接前后并列的两部分。other than常用于否定句中，实际上是对后面部分的肯定，如：I don’t know any French people other than you.除了你，我不认识别的法国人。其他例句：The editors as well as the proofreaders are working overtime.编辑和校对者都在加班工作。I like her more than her husband.我比较喜欢她，不太喜欢她丈夫。

42.[A] only if只要，只有(表条件)          [B] much as尽管，虽然(表让步)

[C] long before早在…以前(表时间)      [D] ever since自从(表时间)

本题考核的知识点是：逻辑关系。正确率：62%

**［快速解题］**  考生需判断空格前后部分之间的逻辑关系。显然，he produces a surplus是he can continue to support himself and his family的前提条件。备选项中只有only if引导条件状语从句，代入句中，意为“只有生产有剩余，农民才能继续养活自己及家人”。这两个分句继续强调储存粮食的必要性，符合上下文意。

**［篇章分析］**  ②句提到农民必须要储存粮食，③句进一步解释这样做的目的：养活自己及家人。②句的store a large quantity of grain和③句的produces a surplus是近义复现，实现了句子之间的语义衔接。

**［空格设置］**  only if体现了主从句之间的逻辑关系，而且only if是if的强调形式，在文中用于强调存储粮食的必要性。only if用于句首时，主句一般要倒装，如：Only if the red light comes on is there anything wrong with the machine.只要红灯一亮，就表示机器出毛病了。②句中的考点还包括：一，熟词僻义。句中support意为to provide everything necessary, esp. money, so that sb/sth can live or exist“养活，赡养，维持”，如：Mark has to support two children from his first marriage.马克得供养他第一次婚姻生的两个孩子。He turned to crime to support his drug habit.他为维持吸毒的恶习而走上犯罪的道路。二，根据上下文选词。句中surplus为名词，意为“过剩（量），剩余（额）”，如：agricultural surpluses过剩的农产品。它和上文store a large quantity相呼应。

**［干扰项设置］**  其他项也是主从复合句的连接词。例句：Much as she needed the job, she had to refuse.虽然她非常需要这份工作，她只能拒绝。She had seen the film abroad long before it was shown in Beijing.早在这部电影在北京上映之前，她就在国外看过了。She had been worrying ever since the letter arrived.自从接到那封信后她就一直焦虑不安。

43.[A] for为了，至于，对于，适用于

[B] against反对，靠着，相反，对…不利,预防

[C] of ……的，关于，对于

[D] towards向，朝，接近，有助于

本题考核的知识点是：介词的用法 + 习惯搭配。正确率：62%

**［快速解题］** ④句提到，农民可以将余粮用于三种用途：as seed，as an insurance和 as a commodity。空格处填入的介词与名词短语the unpredictable effects of bad weather搭配，做insurance的后置定语，意为“作为…恶劣天气影响的保障”。insurance的常见含义是“保险，保障”，也可意为“（防备不测的）保障措施”，常与介词against搭配。余粮当然是一种预防恶劣天气影响的保障措施，能表达“预防”含义的介词只有against。

**［篇章分析］** ③句和④⑤句是并列关系，共同支持②句的观点：必须储存粮食。③句阐述储存余粮的目的；④⑤句介绍余粮的用途。④句主干为He must use this surplus，介词短语in three ways做状语，冒号后三个并列的as...介词结构列举了使用余粮的三种方式。

**［空格设置］** against作为常用介词，其含义和用法非常丰富。against意为“反对，违反；对…不利；倚靠；预防”，如the fight against evil反对邪恶的斗争；The evidence is against him.证据对他不利；Put the piano against the wall.把钢琴紧靠着墙；precautions against fire防火措施。文中取其“预防”的含义。其他考点包括：熟词僻义。本句中insurance意为“（防备不测的）保障措施，安全保证”，如：At that time people had large families as an insurance against some children dying.那时人们养的子女很多，以防有孩子夭折。

**［干扰项设置］** 其他项都是常用的介词。for可指“以帮助，为了……”，如：soldiers fighting for their country为祖国出征的军人；或表示目的或用途，如：a machine for slicing bread（用于）切面包片机。toward可指“对，对于；以……为目的或目标，用于”，如：our attitude towards death我们对死亡的态度；The money will go towards a new school building.这笔资金将用于修建新校舍。of可指“……的”。它们的中文释义都有干扰，要注意各自的用法。

44.[A] replace取代，替换；更新，更换

[B] purchase购买

[C] supplement补充，增补；附录

[D] dispose排列，安排； （~of）处置，部署

本题考核的知识点是：逻辑语义 + 动词词义辨析。正确率：70%

**［快速解题］** 空格所在部分谈到农民把余粮作为商品（as a commodity）出售的目的之一是：4 old agricultural implements，空格处填入的动词说明对“旧农具”施加的动作。出售余粮不应该是为了补充（supplement）或购买（purchase）旧农具，更不可能是为了处置、安排（dispose）旧农具。只有replace表达的“用余粮换得的钱来买新农具以更换旧农具”符合逻辑。

**［篇章分析］**  此处commodity后跟有which引导的定语从句，具体说明余粮作为商品的用途：更换旧农具及购买化肥。定语从句中，in order to连接两个并列的不定式结构to replace...and (to) obtain... 做目的状语。

**［空格设置］**  ④句较长，其中嵌套了which引导的定语从句。replace一词含义虽然简单，但需要通过理解上下文意来解答。例句：to replace meals with snacks不吃正餐，改吃点心；You’ll be expected to replace any broken glasses.玻璃杯如有损坏，要负责赔偿。

**［干扰项设置］**  从语法上讲，其他项都可与implements（工具，器具）构成动宾搭配。例句：They purchased the land for $1 million.他们以100万美元买下了这块土地。a diet supplemented with vitamin pills 有维生素片的饮食。dispose意为“排列，安排，布置”，dispose of sb/sth可意为“处置，清除，销毁”，如：He disposed of his old car.他处理掉他的旧汽车。也指“解决，处理（问题、困难等）；击败，杀死（某人）”。

45.[A] enhance提高，增强，增进（效力、影响、价值等）

[B] mix（使）混合，融合；混淆

[C] feed供给必需品，喂养，饲养

[D] raise种植，饲养；抚养，养育

本题考核的知识点是：动词词义辨析。正确率：40%

**［快速解题］**  空格部分谈到农民把余粮作为商品出售的另一目的：obtain chemical fertilizers to 5 the soil。选项中enhance从含义上看似乎符合上下文语义要求，但它通常与抽象名词搭配；mix the soil指“混合（不同的土壤）”，不符合文意；raise不接soil做宾语。只有feed与soil搭配，feed为引申义，意为“给土壤增加养料”，符合文意。

**［空格设置］**  此题重点考查动词的用法及搭配。feed可意为“为……提供食品，喂（养），养活”，如：You can’t feed a family of five on $100 a week.你无法靠每周100美元的收入来养活一家五口。文中feed是比喻用法，需要根据上下文意理解。

**［干扰项设置］**  enhance在词义上形成干扰，如：Health enhances beauty.健康使人显得更美。mix利用句中出现的两个事物“化肥”与“土壤”形成“将二者混合”的干扰，如：Oil does not mix with water.油不和水相溶。raise对feed构成近义干扰，如：raise corn/cattle种植玉米/养牛；They raised her (as) a Catholic.他们把她培养成为天主教徒。

46.[A] vessels船，容器，导管，脉管    [B] routes路，路线

[C] paths路，小路                     [D] channels渠道，管道

本题考核的知识点是：固定搭配 + 名词词义辨析。正确率：57%

**［快速解题］**  空格处填入的名词与irrigation（灌溉）搭配。四个选项，首先排除routes和paths，它们主要指空中或地面的道路。vessel可以指“导运体液的导管”，但一般是细小的管道，特别是脉管、血管。只有irrigation channel可表示“灌溉水渠”。

**［篇章分析］**  ⑤句和④句后半部分（as a commodity which he must...）含义密切相关。⑤句承接上文，继续介绍余粮被当作商品卖掉后的其他用途：（用卖余粮获得的钱）建灌溉水渠或以其他方式来改进农场。⑤句中also一词表明了它与上文的并列逻辑关系。

**［空格设置］**  名词的固定搭配也是知识运用的常考点。channel含义丰富，意为“电视台，频道；途径，渠道；水渠，河槽，水道，航道，海峡”，如：Complaints must be made through the proper channels.投诉必须通过正当途径进行。drainage channels in the rice fields稻田的排水沟。考生较熟悉的是它的前几个义项，此处考察了它表示“水渠”的含义及与irrigation的搭配。

**［干扰项设置］**  其他项与channel一样，都可以表示“路线、线路”，需要考生能辨清各自的用法。route意为“路线，路途；（公共汽车和列车等的）常规路线，固定路线”，如：a scenic/coastal route景色优美的/沿海的公路；an air/bus route飞行航线/公交路线，它也可比喻为“途径，渠道”，如：the route to fame/power成名的/获取权力的途径。path意为“小路，小径”，也指“（行进的）路线，道路”，如：a bicycle path自行车道；the path of a hurricane飓风行经的路线；它还可比喻为“行动计划，成功途径”，如：a career path职业道路；the path to freedom/success通向自由/成功的道路。vessel可意为“大船；（盛液体的）容器；（人或动物的）脉管，血管，（植物的）导管”，如：blood vessel血管。

47.[A] self-confident自信的               [B] self-sufficient自给自足的

[C] self-satisfied自满的，自鸣得意的   [D] self-restrained自我控制的，有节制的

本题考核的知识点是：形容词词义辨析。正确率：67%

**［快速解题］** 空格所在句子的含义：如果农民没了余粮（来周转），就不能……。［A］、［C］和［D］都是描述人的心理特点的形容词，不符合上下文意；只有［B］表达的“不能自给自足”符合逻辑，下文提到的“他只得变卖部分家产或……贷款”进一步说明了农民不能自给自足的状态。

**［篇章分析］**⑥句是一个承上启下的过渡句，从上文“余粮的作用”转向“农民没有余粮的后果”。 ⑥句是统领了⑦⑧句的总起句。

**［空格设置］**  此题实际上是通过考查复合形容词来考查上下文的语义。self-sufficient与上文③句中support himself and his family遥相呼应，说明的都是农民储备余粮的重要作用。self-sufficient意为“自给自足的，自立的”，如：The country is totally self-sufficient in food production.在粮食生产上，这个国家完全达到了自给自足。

**［干扰项设置］**  其他项都是self-构成的复合形容词，且都可修饰farmers。例句：a self-confident manner自信的态度。He had a self-satisfied smile on his face.他脸上挂着得意洋洋的笑容。her self-restrained smile她克制的微笑。 

48.[A] search搜查             [B] save解救，节省

[C] offer提供，出价        [D] seek寻求，寻找

本题考核的知识点是：动词词义辨析。正确率：68%

［快速解题］ ⑦句指出，（如果农民没有生产剩余）他必须变卖部分家产或以贷款的形式……额外的资金。因此“节省（save）额外的资金”或“提供（offer）额外的资金给别人”都不符合文意。search作“找寻”讲时，应搭配介词for。因此正确答案是seek，放入文中，意为“寻求以贷款的形式获得的额外资金”。

**［篇章分析］**  ⑦句是分叙句，具体论述⑥句中的cannot be self-sufficient：他或者需要变卖财产，或者需要借贷。

**［空格设置］** 本题既考查了动词与名词（extra funds in the form of loans）的搭配，又考查了上下文意。seek意为“寻找；寻求，谋求”，如：seek new ways of expanding membership探索发展会员的新途径。

**［干扰项设置］**  其他项都可接funds做宾语，尤其是search干扰性较强，因此必须理解上下文并准确掌握动词用法，才能排除干扰。save可意为“节省”；offer可意为“提供，供给”；search意为“搜索，搜寻，搜查”，接表示地点的名词做宾语，或用~for sth/sb，表示“找寻（某人/物）”，如：searched the plane for survivors搜查飞机寻找幸存者，She searched in vain for her passport.她翻找自己的护照，但没找着。

49.[A] proportion比例，比率，均衡     [B] percentage百分比

[C] rate比率，速度，等级               [D] ratio比率，对比，比值

本题考核的知识点是：固定搭配。正确率：61%

**［快速解题］** 根据⑦句中的loans（贷款）以及本句的borrow money，可以推测出9of interest 应表示利率。rate of interest或interest rate意为“利率”，是固定搭配。

**［篇章分析］**  ⑦⑧句是承接关系，⑦句提到农民不能自足时，要去借贷，⑧句说明借贷时会遇到的困难。⑧句中borrow money与⑦句中extra funds in the form of loans是近义复现，实现了句子之间的衔接。

**［空格设置］** 本题考查名词的搭配用法。rate可意为“比率，率”，指一定时期内事情发生的次数或事例存在的个数的测量方法，如：the annual divorce rate离婚率；或指“（收取或付给的固定的）费用，价格”，如：a low/high hourly rate of pay按小时支付的低/高报酬；the basic rate of tax基本税额。文中用到的是第二个含义。

**［干扰项设置］**  其他项都可以表示某种比例关系，构成对rate的近义干扰。proportion意为“比例，比率”，常见用法有the proportion of sth to sth（即事物或事物各部分之间在大小、数量或程度上的关系），如：the proportion of births to deaths人口出生与死亡的比例；另一个是in proportion to （数量之间的一种关系，暗指如果一方发生变化则另一方也随之发生相应的变化），如：happiness not in proportion to virtue幸福与美德不成比例。percentage意为“百分比”，如：What percentage of the students were absent?旷课的学生占百分之几？ratio指“两件相似事情在程度或数量上的对比关系”，如：The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in water is 2 to 1. 水中氢和氧的比率是2∶1。

\50. [A] genuinely真诚地，诚实地        [B] obviously明显地

[C] presumably可能地，大概,推测起来        [D] frequently经常地

本题考核的知识点是：上下文语义+副词词义辨析。正确率：67%

**［快速解题］** 空格处是but引导的转折分句，前文提到农民自然想获得低利率贷款，后半句转折指出：但是这种低息贷款并不…得到。四个选项中，首先排除genuinely，它在语义上不与obtainable搭配。obviously表示的“明显不可获得”过于绝对，不符合逻辑。presumably一般做句子副词单独使用，不和其他形容词连用。从意义上来看，只有［D］符合题意，“不经常（frequently）可以得到”表示这样的机会很少。

**［篇章分析］** ⑧句是一个由but连接的表转折关系的并列句，this kind即指上文low rate of interest（低利率）。

**［空格设置］**  本题通过考查副词词义，实际考查考生对上下文语义的理解，not frequently与上文Naturally he will存在转折关系。

**［干扰项设置］** 其他项都是副词，是根据中文含义设置的干扰。例句：He genuinely believes in what he sells.他真地相信他卖的东西。 He was obviously drunk.他显然是喝醉了。Presumably the bad weather has delayed the flight.大概恶劣的天气使飞机误点了。

 

**三、全文翻译**

一个农民要想成功，就必须在消费和生产之间努力保持着较大的差距。他必须存储大量的粮食而不是立即把所有的粮食都消费掉。只有生产有剩余，农民才能继续养活自己及家人。他必须用以下三种方式来使用这些余粮：留作种子，留作预防恶劣天气影响的保障措施，以及作为商品卖掉，来更换旧农具和购买化肥给土壤施肥。他可能还需要钱来修建灌溉水渠，或在其他方面改善自己的农场。如果没有余粮，农民就不能自给自足，他就只得变卖部分家产或通过贷款寻求额外的资金。自然，他会尽量争取低息贷款，但这种贷款不是经常能够得到的。

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| [A] it had made painstaking efforts towards this goal        | [A] 它为实现这一目标付出了艰辛的努力   |
| [B] its domestic market was eight times larger than   before | [B] 其国内市场比以前大八倍             |

| [D] the unparalleled size of its workforce had given   an impetus to its economy | [D] 空前规模的劳动力促进了其经济的发展 |

本题考核的知识点是：因果细节。正确率：67%

**［快速解题］** 根据题干时间关键词after World War Ⅱ定位到第一段②句。该段列举了美国取得霸主地位的多个原因。末句提到：美国的国富民强是欧亚国家做梦都想不到的，因为战争摧毁了后者的经济。由此可推知［C］正确。［A］中painstaking efforts与①句的effortless success相悖。［B］比较对象错误，文中指出美国的市场比竞争者大八倍，而［B］成了美国自身的前后比较。［D］出现了文中未提的对象“空前规模的劳动力”，而原文谈及的是“空前的产业经济规模”。

**［篇章分析］** 第一段首句阐述了作者两个层次的观点：一，毫不不费力获得持久成功的历史可能成为一种可怕的障碍；二，若处理得当，则这种障碍可以成为动力。随后三句构成的义群对首句的“毫不不费力获得持久成功的历史”进行具体阐述。②句的such a glowing period回指①句的A history of long and effortless success。这三句列举了二战后美国无可比拟的五个经济优势，也就是其获得经济霸主地位的原因，从而说明二战后美国的经济繁荣时期是一段毫不费力获得成功的历史。所列举的五个原因中，前四个较明显，正面论述美国的经济优势：大市场、大规模的产业经济、最优秀的科学家、技术最娴熟的工人。最后一个间接论述美国的优势：其主要竞争对手的经济遭到战争破坏。

**［正确项设置］** 正确答案的信息隐含于第一段末句的定语从句中。末句的主句指出了美国的经济霸主地位：美国的国富民强令欧亚国家难以望其项背，从句暗含了原因：战争摧毁了欧亚国家（美国的多数潜在竞争对手）的经济。［C］是末句的改写，用most potential competitors替换末句中的the Europeans and Asians。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］根据首句中关键词effortless以及人们的常规思维——成功往往需要巨大的努力——设置反向干扰。［B］、［D］偷梁换柱：［B］将②句中的比较对象“(U. S.) than any competitor”替换成“(then) than before”；［D］将②句中的unparalleled economies of scale和③句中的workers糅合成unparalleled size of its workforce。

**［快速解题］** 根据题干时间关键词1980s先定位到第二段③句。由于备选项涉及了四个具体产业的事实细节，因此进一步定位到⑤至⑨句，将原文与选项对比，判别事实真伪。［A］与⑤⑥句的事实不符——美国最后一家电视生产厂家都被外国公司收购（Now there is none）。⑦句提到，“外国制造的汽车和纺织品正在大举进入国内市场”，言外之意，美国的这两个行业正在失去部分国内市场，因此［D］正确。⑧句提到美国机床工业岌岌可危（on the ropes），没有提到它“已经灭亡”或“有自杀性行动”，排除［C］。末句提到，半导体制造业似乎将要成为下一个“受害者”，（即，与其他行业一样，也将失去国内市场）。但词组looked as though和was going to说明它只是一种可能性，并未成为事实。［B］指出其已经被外国公司接管，不符合文意。

**［篇章分析］** 继第一段“美国战后轻而易举获得成功”之后，第二段开始转入对“80年代美国丧失经济霸主地位”的描述，从而论证全文首句中第一层次的观点：毫不不费力获得持久成功的历史可能成为一种可怕的障碍。该段前三句阐述“美国丧失经济霸主地位”的事实，通过同义表达的复现（primacy should have narrowed，retreat from predominance和fading industrial competitiveness）实现了句子间的衔接。①句分析了原因：其他国家日益强盛，即竞争对手的竞争力增强；②③句指出了影响：令美国人感到痛苦和不知所措。④句至段末列举美国多个产业（消费电子业、汽车业、纺织业、机床业、半导体业）的衰败证明其经济霸主地位已经丧失。

**［正确项设置］** ［D］是⑦句的同义表达。第二段在提到汽车和纺织业时，是从“外国商品入侵美国国内市场”的角度间接地说明其衰败的。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］、［B］偷梁换柱。［A］将第⑤⑤句隐含的信息lost all its domestic market偷换成withdrawn to its domestic market。［B］将末句的将来时态was going to be替换成过去完成时had been。［C］利用考生对短语on the ropes的不熟悉，添加无关信息collapsed after suicidal actions。

本题考核的知识点是：推理引申。正确率：49%

**［快速解题］** 题干没有提供定位信息。因此只能每个选项分别定位。此外，题干中infer一词说明正确项的内容是文中暗示而没有直接陈述的内容。本文始终将“竞争”与“经济兴衰”联系在一起：当竞争对手的经济遭受战争破坏时，美国毫不费力地享有经济霸主地位；当竞争日益激烈时，美国的经济开始衰退，并由此而反思、警惕，最后实现了经济的复苏。可见，激烈竞争促使美国人作出改变，从而间接上促进了经济的发展。［B］符合文意。

根据［A］的关键词self-doubt and blind pride定位到第四段④句。该句提到“自我怀疑被盲目骄傲取代”，并没有说它们之间的相互转换，更没有说这是人的本质。所以［A］不正确。［C］中“国际合作”在文中根本没有提及。根据［D］的关键词A long history of success定位到第一段首句，该句指出持久成功的历史可能成为可怕的障碍。第一、二段论述的“美国在持续成功后出现经济的衰退”也证明了这一点。由此排除［D］。

**［篇章分析］** 第三段承接第二段，叙述美国人面对经济衰退而作出的反思和调整。前三句指出经济衰退使美国人出现信心危机：不再视繁荣为理所当然之事；开始对自己的商业经营方式和未来的收入都失去了信心。②句暗含了一个信息：美国人曾经将经济繁荣视为理所当然的态度加速了美国经济的衰退。后两句叙述美国采取的措施：不断探究产业衰退的原因；发出海外竞争压力日益增长的警告。

第四段前两句指出，90年代美国经济取得了复苏。至此，全文首句中第二层次的观点得到了论证：若处理得当，则这种障碍可以成为动力。

**［正确项设置］** 正确答案的信息跨越多个段落，且非常隐蔽。第二至四段的因果链条是：激烈竞争——经济霸主地位的丧失——反省警惕——经济复苏，［B］指出了该链条中隐含的间接因果关系。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］根据第四段④句设置，将文中yielded to替换成shift between，并添加无关信息human nature。［C］也根据因果关系设置，编造原因international cooperation。［D］反向干扰，将全文首句中的be a dreadful handicap改为pave the way for。

本题考核的知识点是：作者观点。正确率：34%

**［快速解题］** 根据题干中时间关键词1990s 定位到第四段。③句指出，鲜有美国人将经济的增长仅仅归因于美元贬值或经济周期变化这些显而易见的原因。④句称这种态度为“盲目骄傲”。由此可知，它们可能是作者认同的真正原因。故［A］正确。［B］、［C］分别是下文引用的专家Richard Cavanaugh和Stephen Moore认可的原因，它们是“盲目乐观”的引证，因此是作者批判的观点。［D］文中未提及。

**［篇章分析］** 第四段前两句指出美国经济得以复苏，③④句分析其影响：美国没有理性地认识它的真实原因，而是表现出盲目骄傲。⑤至⑦句引用专家的话来证明盲目骄傲态度的存在。

**［正确项设置］** ［A］是第四段③句暗含的作者观点。第四段主要从两个方面论证经济复苏带来的“盲目骄傲”。其一，指出很少有人意识到经济增长的更可能的原因；其二，引证“盲目骄傲”的错误观点。

**［干扰项设置］** ［B］、［C］利用第四段引用的他人观点作为干扰。因此考生一定要分清哪些是作者自己的观点，哪些是作者引用的观点。［D］无中生有。

 

**三、句式结构分析**

1.A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly handled, it may become a driving force. 

该句由but连接的两个转折关系的并列分句构成。But与后一个分句之间插入if引导的条件状语从句。

2.When the United States entered just such a glowing period after the end of the Second World War, it had a market eight times larger than any competitor, giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale. 

句子主干是 ... it had a market ...。主语之前是 When引导的时间状语从句；现在分词giving相当于which gave...，为结果状语。unparalleled意为“无法比拟的，空前的”。

3.For a while it looked as though［the making of semiconductors, which America had invented and which sat at the heart of the new computer age, was going to be the next casualty］.

主句主语和谓语是it looked；as though引导的从句做looked的表语，其中在这个表语从句的主语the making of semiconductors和谓语was  going to be...之间，又插入了两个并列的定语从句修饰semiconductors。casualty本意是“伤亡人数，受害人”，这里指“被外国产品击败的美国本土产品”。

4.American industry has changed its structure, has gone on a diet, has learnt to be more quick-witted. 

这句话在文中是用暗喻的方法，把“企业精简机构提高效率”与“人通过适当节食促进身体健康”进行类比，达到形象生动的效果。我们可以反过来形容人，如：Mr. Smith was advised by the doctor to lose weight. Now he has changed his body structure, has gone on a diet, has learned to be more quick-moving.

 

**四、全文翻译**

**一段毫不费力就可以获得持久成功的历史可能成为一种可怕的障碍，但若处理得当，它也有可能转化为一种推动力。**（句式1**）二战结束后，美国恰好进入了这样的一段辉煌时期，当时，它拥有比任何竞争者大八倍的市场，使其产业经济达到了前所未有的规模。**（句式2）它已拥有世界上最优秀的科学家和技术最娴熟的工人。美国的国富民强是那些经济遭到战争破坏的欧亚诸国做梦也无法想像的。

随着其他国家日益强盛，美国的这一领先优势逐渐缩小，这是不可避免的。领先优势的丧失同样不可避免地令人感到痛苦。到了80年代中期，面对其日益衰退的产业竞争力，美国人感到不知所措。面对国外竞争，一些大型的美国产业，如消费电子业，已经萎缩或倒闭。到1987年，美国只剩下Zenith这一家电视生产商（现在一家也没有了：Zenith已于7月被韩国LG电器公司收购）。外国制造的汽车和纺织品正在大举进入美国国内市场。美国的机床产业也岌岌可危。**半导体是美国人发明的，并在计算机新时代处于核心地位，但有一段时间，半导体制造业似乎将要成为下一个“受害者”。**（句式3）

所有这一切引发了一场信心危机。美国不再视繁荣为理所当然之事。他们开始相信自己的商业经营方式不灵了，也相信不久他们的收入会因此而下降。80年代中期，人们不断地探究美国产业衰退的原因。偶尔一些耸人听闻的发现中充满着对海外竞争压力日益增长的警告之词。

情况变化尤为神速！1995年，当日本还在奋力挣扎的时候，美国却可以对五年的稳固发展作一回顾了。很少有美国人将此仅仅归因于美元贬值或经济的周期循环这些显而易见的原因。于是，自我怀疑被盲目乐观所取代。用哈佛大学肯尼迪管理学院行政院长理查德·卡佛纳的话说就是：**“美国产业已经调整了其结构，进行了精简，反应也更敏捷了”。**（句式4）华盛顿特区的智囊团——卡托研究院的史蒂芬·莫尔也说：“我们的企业正在提高生产率，作为一个美国人，我感到自豪。”哈佛商学院的威廉·萨尔曼相信人们回顾这段时期时，将把它视为“美国企业管理的黄金时代”。

**Passage 2**

 

**一、文章结构分析**

本文是一篇关于人类进化的文章。先指出人类进化自然选择的因素已消失，进而说明人类身体已经停止进化并指出其社会原因。

第一段：指出自然选择的两个因素都已消失：男性死亡率和婴儿体重的差别。主要使用了（现在与过去）对比论证。

第二段：指出造成人类进化停止的另一个因素是：子女数目减少，并以印度为例进行说明。

第三段：总结全文，指出以上这些现象意味着人类进化已经结束，并分析其社会原因。

 

**二、试题具体分析**





















| 55.What used to be the danger in being a man according   to the first paragraph? | 15.按照文章第一段，过去身为男性面临的危险是什么？ |

| [A] A lack of mates.                                         | [A] 缺乏配偶。                                    |
| [B] A fierce competition.                                    | [B] 激烈的竞争。                                  |
| [C] A lower survival rate.                                   | [C] 存活率低。                                    |

本题考核的知识点是：具体细节。正确率：52%

**［快速解题］** 第一段①句指出过去存在的情况：作为男人充满危险。第二句用男女比例变化的数据予以说明：出生时男性比女性多，到成年期男女数量达到平衡，到70岁时女性比男性多一倍。从这个变化过程可以推出过去男性存活率普遍低于女性。此外，紧跟着的③句指出“（过去）男性死亡率普遍偏高的情况（the great universal of male mortality）正在改变”，因此［C］正确。从上述分析可知，到了成年期，男女的比例基本持平，因此男性不存在［A］ “缺乏配偶”的危险。［B］未在文中提到。本段只在最后一句提到“基因差异”（variation is due to genes），并没有提到“基因缺陷”，排除［D］。

**［篇章分析］** 第一段指出自然选择的两个因素已消失。①至⑤句构成的意群指出，男女存活率的差异已经消失。①句用简洁概括的语言指出，过去身为男性总是充满危险。②句用数据对这种“危险”予以说明：在整个生命过程中，男性的存活率低于女性。...born...maturity...70-years-olds...构成的时间链串起了人的整个生命历程。③句为过渡句，指出这种情况已发生改变。is being changed说明这种变化是由于人为作用引起的。④⑤句指出现在的情况：男女的存活率已经几乎相同。⑥至⑩句构成的意群为“总——分——总”结构。⑥句为过渡句兼意群主旨句，承接上文指出，自然选择的另一个（another）因素也已消失。⑦至⑨句通过对比现在和过去的情况（Fifty years ago... Today）指出，体重几乎不再影响到婴儿的存活率。⑩句总结指出，这意味着又一个进化因素的消失。

**［正确项设置］** ［C］是第一段②句的言外之意。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］对②句105 males born for every 100 females断章取义。但这种差异存在于“婴儿期”而不是“成年期”。［B］无中生有。［D］偷梁换柱，将“基因差异”偷换为“基因缺陷”。





















| 56.What does the example of India illustrate?                | 16.印度的例子说明了什么？                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| [A] Wealthy people tend to have fewer children than   poor people. | [A] 富人往往比穷人的孩子少。               |
| [B] Natural selection hardly works among the rich and   the poor. | [B] 自然选择在穷人和富人中几乎都不起作用。 |
| [C] The middle class population is 80% smaller than   that of the tribes. | [C] 中产阶级的人口比部落人口少80%。        |
| [D] India is one of the countries with a very high   birth rate. | [D] 印度是出生率很高的国家之一。           |

本题考核的知识点是：写作目的。正确率：60%

**［快速解题］** 第二段最后两句介绍了印度的情况：这个国家少数居住在大城市的人拥有财富，而其他部落民族却很贫穷。但如今，无论贫富，每一个人都同样地生存并且拥有同样多的子女，这意味着自然选择对印度的富有阶层也不再起很大作用。而举例之前的观点论述（⑥句）是该例子要说明的，即：人与人之间的差异和利用差异进行自然选择的机会再一次减少。因此，［B］是举例所要说明的。［A］与第二段末句谈到的“极其显著的平均化——每个人的生存机会和子女数量都相同”事实不符。第二段末句提到80%是为了说明中上阶层与部落在自然选择因素上的差异大大缩小，不是具体说明它们人口数量的差异，［C］无从推知。［D］在文中未提及。

**［篇章分析］** 第二段和第一段为并列关系，指出造成人类进化停止的另一个因素。①句为段落主旨句，指出该因素是子女数目减少。②到⑤句具体阐述这一因素的消失：相比过去，人们的子女数目减少；子女数目和寿命都趋于平均化。⑥句总结指出，人与人之间的差异和利用这种差异进行自然选择的机会都减少。⑦到⑨句以印度为例论证前文观点。⑦句为过渡句，说明下文举例是为了论证上文观点。⑧⑨句之间存在对比关系：（本来）财富差异使得印度的中上层具有绝对的优势，但随着子女数目和寿命的平均化，中上层失去了这种绝对优势（lost 80% of its power）。

**［正确项设置］** ⑧⑨句关于印度的例子中存在多种比较，［B］是结合例子和所论证的观点（⑥句和⑨句）的阐述,对应⑨句中has lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］对事实进行反向干扰，对应第二段末句中everyone being the same in... number of offspring。［C］偷换概念，将第二段末句中“自然选择影响力的比较”偷换成“人口数量的比较”。［D］利用常识设置无关干扰。





















| 57.The author argues that our bodies have stopped   evolving because. | 17.作者认为我们的身体不再进化的原因是。 |

| [D] the difference between wealth and poverty is disappearing | [D] 贫富差别正在逐渐消失                |

本题考核的知识点是：因果细节。正确率：82%

**［快速解题］** 根据题干关键词our bodies have stopped evolving定位到第三段④⑤句。④句指出事实，我们的身体在过去10万年乃至100年中没有改变。⑤句指出原因：机器和社会代替我们进化了。即，技术的进步改善了人的生活，造成人身体进化的停止。［A］正确。［B］与题干无关，而且也与第一段的事实不符。［C］是题干“我们不再进化”的换一种说法，而不是原因。文中只提到贫富者之间在生育率方面不再有差别，而未一概而论所有差别都消失，排除［D］。

**［篇章分析］** 第三段指出人类进化已经停止。①句为过渡句，基于上文“多个进化因素的消失”的分析，指出人类进化已经结束。分号表示解释说明。②至④句进一步指出人的身体已经停止进化。⑤句指出其原因：机器和社会代替我们进化了。⑥句借用达尔文的比喻说明“进化远远超出人们的想像（savage looks at a ship，beyond his comprehension）”。⑦⑧句指出：（同样，）人类生活方式会进化（未来回顾20世纪的生活方式，它是原始的、丑陋的），但人类身体不会再继续进化（our descendants will look just like us）。

**［正确项设置］** ［A］对应⑤句machines and society did it for us。

**［干扰项设置］** ［B］和［D］根据前两段介绍的“男女存活率差异的消失”和“贫富阶层的生育率的差异在消失”捏造干扰信息。［C］是第三段①句the biological Utopia has arrived的同义改写。

| [D] Human Evolution Going Nowhere.                           | [D]人的进化已穷尽。               |

本题考核的知识点是：文章主旨。正确率：69%

**［快速解题］** 通观全文，第一段指出，由于促使自然选择的因素一个一个地消失了，自然选择的规律无法再保证人类的优胜劣汰。第二段以印度为例说明孩子数量的平均化这种“自杀性行为”导致自然选择的差异变小。最后一段中作者指出，人类进化已经结束。所以［D］是合适的标题。

**［正确项设置］** ［D］是文章主题句（第三段①句）的改写，going nowhere 同义替换is over。

**［干扰项设置］** 其他项都涉及文章关键词evolution，增强了干扰。但［A］太窄，“性别比例的改变”只在第一段提到，不足以概括全文内容；［B］离题甚远，既然进化已经结束，又何来延续；［C］的nature太泛，future则和文中的时态不符。

 

**三、句式结构分析**

1.There are about 105 males born for every 100 females, but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice as many women as men.

“出生时男女比例大约为105∶100，但是到了成熟期，这种比例下降几乎达到平衡；在70岁的老人中女性比男性多一倍”。这句话是拿男性和女性在不同时期的数量做比较，注意其中用了几种不同的表达法：There are about...M for every...F，this ratio drops to near balance，among...there are twice as many F as M。这些结构在图表作文中可以使用。

2.There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but have fewer children.

该句写作手法诙谐，把少生孩子的这种行为夸大，称之为“进化自杀”。

3.Again, differences between people and the opportunity for natural selection to take advantage of it have diminished.

该句主干是differences... and opportunity... have diminished。本句的难点在于opportunity后面的定语成分是不定式结构for...to take advantage of it，其中的关键又是代词it，它回指前面的differences，opportunity及其定语成分的意思是“自然选择利用这种差异的机会”。

4.The grand mediocrity of today-everyone being the same in survival and number of offspring-means that［natural selection has lost 80% of its power in  upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes］. 

该句的主干是The grand mediocrity of today... means that... 。主语mediocrity原意指“平庸，普通”，破折号为该词的同位语，可以确定该词在这里的特定含义是“大家都活一样长，都生一样多的孩子”。that引导的宾语从句中，compared to the tribes为状语。

5.For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived.

知识点补充：Utopia（乌托邦）指什么都很完美的地方或状态，例： Create a political Utopia 创造政治的乌托邦。

6.Darwin had a phrase to describe those ignorant of evolution: they “look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension”.

该句的主干是Darwin had a phrase，不定式结构to describe... 做phrase的后置定语。冒号后的部分是phrase的同位语，对其进行解释说明。这个部分的结构为“A look at B just as C look at D”，句中这个比喻可以用来描述对某些事情一无所知的人。句末为省略结构，即as (a savage looks) at something wholly beyond his comprehension。

7.But however amazed our descendants may be at how far from Utopia we were, they will look just like us.

前半句是由however引导的让步状语从句，修饰提前的表语amazed，主要意思是“无论我们的后代对……多么吃惊”。however引导让步从句时，相当于no matter how，后面接形容词或副词，例：However carefully I explained, she still didn’t understand. 无论我解释得多么详细，她还是没弄懂。

 

**四、全文翻译**

**身为男性总是有危险，男女出生时的比例大约是105∶100，但到了成年期，这一比例几乎持平，而在70岁的老年人中女性是男性的两倍。**（句式1）但是男性死亡率普遍偏高的情况正在改变。如今，男婴存活率几乎同女婴一样高。这就意味着到了男孩寻找伴侣的关键年龄，将首次出现男孩过剩现象。更重要的是，自然选择的另一次机会也已不复存在了。50年前，婴儿（尤其是男婴）存活的机率取决于体重，轻一公斤或重一公斤几乎意味着必死无疑。现在，体重几乎不起什么作用。因为大部分差异是由基因引起的，所以进化的又一个因素消失了。

**进化自杀还有另一种方法：活着，但少生孩子。**（句式2）现在，没有几个人像过去那样具有旺盛的生育力。除了在一些宗教团体之外，几乎没有妇女能够生育15个孩子。当今出生的人数同死亡年龄一样已趋于平均化，我们多数人的子女数量大致相同。**而且，人与人之间的差异和利用这种差异进行自然选择的机会都已经减少。**（句式3）印度可以说明正在发生的一切。这个国家给大城市里的少数人提供财富，而给其余的各部落民族以贫困。**今天这种极其显著的平均化——每个人的生存机会和子女数量都相同——意味着与部落相比，自然选择在印度中、上阶层已经失去了80%的效力。**（句式4）

**对我们来说，这意味着进化已经结束；生物学上的乌托邦已经来临。**（句式5）奇怪的是，这一过程几乎丝毫没有牵涉到人身体上的变化。没有其他哪种物种在自然界中占有这么大的空间。但在过去的10万年——甚至过去的100年中，我们的生活发生了变化，但我们的身体却没有改变。我们没有进化。因为机器和社会代替我们进化了。**达尔文曾用这样一句话描述那些对进化一无所知的人：他们“看有机的生命如同野人看船，好像看着某种完全不能理解的东西”。**（句式6）毫无疑问，人类在回顾20世纪的生活方式时，会因其丑陋不堪而不能理解。但是，**不管我们的子孙后代对我们离乌托邦的理想境界还差很远感到多么惊讶，他们的样子会同我们差不了多少。**（句式7）

 

**Passage 3**

 

**一、文章结构分析**

这是一篇关于未来派诗歌这种新文学形式的文学评论。文章介绍了未来派诗歌的观点，并对其进行批评，指出很难将其归入文学范畴。文章为总-分-总的结构。

本题考核的知识点是：文章主旨。正确率：56%

**［快速解题］** 本题涉及全文主旨，可以作为最后一道题来解答。首段给出了作者对未来派诗歌的总体评价——即使承认其理论根据，也很难将其视为文学作品。第二段介绍了未来派诗歌倡导者的观点，而其理论前提在全文最后受到了作者的质疑（The whole question is...）。第三段首句评价未来派诗歌令人费解，并以一首诗为例说明。第四段作者再次评价未来派诗歌很难被归入文学。因此，［B］是全文论述的内容。

**［正确/干扰项设置］** ［B］是文章主题的集中体现，futurist poetry是贯穿全文的中心词汇。［A］、［D］都缺失了全文的关键词futurist poetry，［A］太泛，缺乏针对性，［D］利用第四段首句中the laws and requirements设置无关干扰。［C］与作者的否定态度相悖。

**［快速解题］** 文章首句指出，当一场新的艺术运动形成某种风尚时，理应弄清其倡导者的目的所在……。［A］正确。

**［篇章分析］** 第一段从“普遍原理”到“特殊个例”，引出文章主旨。①句阐述普遍原理，为主题的出现作铺垫：只要弄清楚新艺术运动倡导者的目的，那么无论他们的观念多么不可思议，将来都有可能被接受。②句介绍“特殊个例”，引出主旨：即使了解了未来派诗歌倡导者的目的，仍然很难将其接受为文学作品。

**［正确/干扰项设置］** ［A］和题干是①句前半部分（When a new movement... are aiming at）的同义改写，［A］对应文中find out what its advocates are aiming at。其他项利用①句中的个别词汇（unreasonable，fashion，principles）设置无关干扰。

本题考核的知识点是：观点细节。正确率：87%

**［快速解题］** 根据题干关键词futurist claim定位到第二段。由③句“这种加速的生活节奏需要一种新的表达形式（a new form of expression）”，可知［C］正确。④句中speed up our literature指“使文学的表现形式更富有速度感以诠释现代生活的节奏”，与数量无关，排除［A］。该句也提到，未来派诗人主张用诗歌诠释（interpret）现代生活的压力，而不是减轻，排除［B］。第五句提到，诗歌的表达不应受句号、修饰性形容词和限定动词的过多限制，但并非完全不能用形容词和动词，排除［D］。

**［篇章分析］** 第二段介绍了未来派诗歌倡导者的观点，即目的。①句指出，人类生活状况飞速变化，生活环境充斥着喧器、暴力和快节奏。②句指出，人类的感情、思想和情绪也随之产生了快速的变化。③④句指出，加速的生活节奏需要新的表达形式，即加速的文学形式。⑤⑥句指出这种文学形式的具体表现。

**［正确/干扰项设置］** ［C］为③句a new form of expression的同义替换。［A］是④句中speed up our literature的曲解。［B］偷梁换柱，将④句中express偷换为relieve。［D］是⑤句中unhampered by... finite verbs的曲解。

本题考核的知识点是：作者观点。正确率：59%

**［快速解题］**  通读全文，作者对未来派诗歌持完全否定的态度。第一段末句和最后一段首句都提到，即使承认其理论基础的合理性，也很难将其归入文学。［D］符合此意。其他选项均有肯定成分，与全文基调不符，应排除。［A］过于肯定，作者只是假设其理论合理。［B］与作者认为它“很难作为新文学形式被人们接受”的观点相悖。［C］不是未来派提出的，他们只谈到生活环境和思想感情的变化。

**［篇章分析］** 第三段与上文构成转折，以一首描述战斗的诗歌说明：（虽然未来派诗歌倡导者的目的已经很明确，但是）诗歌的描述却令人费解。

第四段①句评价以上这首诗很难被看作文学。②③句让步转折，先肯定未来派诗歌倡导者的基本观点，接着质疑其理论前提，从而更进一步证明很难将其归入文学之列。

**［正确/干扰项设置］** ［D］是贯穿全文的观点，另外，全文基调（对未来派诗歌的完全否定）也是判断［D］正确的重要依据。［A］将作者的让步假设看做作者承认的事实。［B］根据文章首句中new movement，be regarded as normal设置干扰。［C］无中生有。

 

**三、句式结构分析**

1.When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its advocates are aiming at, for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles may seem today, it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. 

该句的主干是 it is advisable to find out ...,  for ... it is possible that...。句首when引导的是一个时间状语从句。在表示原因的分句for ... it is possible that...中插入however引导的让步状语从句“无论他们的准则在今天看来是多么牵强附会、多么不可思议”。attains a certain fashion意为“兴盛一时”。

2.With regard to Futurist poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist poetry may be—even admitting that the theory on which it is based may be right—it can hardly be classed as Literature. 

该句的主干是...the case is difficult..., 前面with介词结构做状语，即“就未来派诗歌而言”；however 是插入语，单独使用表明整个这句话和其上文存在转折关系。主句后接for引导的表示原因的并列分句 it can hardly be classed as Literature。该分句中有两个表让步的状语成分：一个是whatever引导的从句；一个破折号之间的插入语，即admitting分词结构。分词结构中on which it is based是修饰the theory的定语从句。with regard to sb/sth意为“关于某人或某事，在这点/那点上”，例： I have nothing to say with regard to your complaints. 对你的抱怨，我无话可说。

3.But it is a little upsetting to read in the explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a bridge off which they both fall into the river—and then to find that the line consists of the noise of their falling and the weights of the officers: “Pluff! Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five kilograms.”

句子主干是it is a little upsetting to read ... and then to find...，其中it是形式主语，指代的是to read ... and then to find...两个不定式结构；其中不定式结构中的动词read和find分别接有that引导的宾语从句做宾语，即：that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a bridge... 和that the line consists of the noise of their falling and the weights of the officers...。前一分句中off which they both fall into the river是修饰bridge的定语从句。

 

四**、全文翻译**

**当一场新的艺术运动形成某种风尚时，明智的做法是弄清其倡导者的目的所在，因为无论他们的观念在今天看来是多么牵强附会、多么不可思议，将来都有可能被视为是正常的。**(句式1)**然而，就未来派诗歌而言，情况却比较复杂，因为无论未来派诗歌为何物，即使承认其理论根据可能正确，也很难将它归入文学。**(句式2)

简而言之，未来派诗人这样宣称：一个世纪以来，过去的生活状况一直在有条件地飞速变化；现在，我们生活在一个充斥着喧器、暴力和快节奏的世界之中。因此，我们的感情、思想和情绪都产生了相应的变化。未来派诗人声称，这种加速的生活节奏需要一种新的表达形式。如果我们想诠释现代生活的压力，就必须加快文学发展的步伐。我们必须大量使用基本词汇，摆脱句号、修饰性形容词及限定动词的羁绊。我们不是要描绘声音，而是必须造出模仿声音的词语；我们必须在同一张纸上使用不同型号的字体和不同颜色的墨水，任意缩短或加长词语。

毫无疑问，他们对战斗的描述会令人费解。**但是读到一句描写战斗的诗行的注解时，则更令人生厌。注解中说该诗描写了一名土耳其军官和一名保加利亚军官在一座桥上发生了搏斗，结果双双从桥上掉进河中——后来发现这一行诗文是由军官落水的声音和他们的体重组成的：“扑通！扑通！一百八十五公斤。”**(句式3)

尽管这种写法符合未来派诗歌的规则和要求，但是却很难被归入文学之列。同样，任何一个有思想的人都不会拒绝接受他们的基本主张：情感生活的巨大变化要求表达方式也随之变化。但实际问题是：我们发生了根本的变化吗？

本题考核的知识点是：推理引申。正确率：48%

**［快速解题］** 根据题干关键词postwar定位到文章首句。该句指出，战后日本的生产力水平与社会的和谐程度为美国和欧洲所称羡（the envy of意为“羡慕的对象”），可见在西方人眼中，日本是一个成功的范例，因此正确选项为［B］。由Aimlessness和hardly两个否定词可得出肯定结论：无目标性一直不是战后日本的典型特点（即：其发展目标明确）。排除［A］。文中只提到日本为西方国家所称羡，而未提及［C］。［D］是当今日本的情况，不是战后的特点。

**［篇章分析］** 第一段提出全文讨论的现象。①②句先扬后抑，先指出战后日本的强盛（其目标明确、生产力增长迅速、社会和谐令西方人羡慕），接着转折后引入话题：如今的日本传统工作道德价值观丧失。③句是②句的阐述，通过对比十年前日本人的工作态度（年轻人努力工作且视工作为自身存在的主要理由）和现在的工作态度（年轻人不知何去何从），说明日本传统工作道德价值观的丧失。

**［正确项设置］** ［B］为第一段①句内容的概括，体现了作者引入主题的方法。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］反向干扰，忽略了①句中的否定副词hardly。［C］偷换概念，将①句中the envy偷换成a rival。［D］张冠李戴，把当今日本的情况说成是战后日本的特征。

本题考核的知识点是：因果细节。正确率：44%

**［快速解题］** 文章第二至四段分析了日本道德水平下降的多种原因。第四段首句“（日本社会中道德观的弱化）更与生活方式的改变有关”说明，［D］是主要原因。［A］与第二段首句指出的“女性进入过去男性主导的就业市场”不符。［B］在第二段末句提到，但“相比其他国家的工人，更多日本工人对工作不满”应该是日本道德水平下降的表现而非原因。［C］错在excessive。第三段首句只提到，日本重视基础教育的同时忽视了创造力和自我表达的培养，并没有提及“对基础教育的重视过度”。

**［篇章分析］** 继第一段提出现象“日本传统道德价值观沦丧”之后，第二至四段层层深入，剖析了现象背后的原因。第二段分析社会原因：年轻人因发展机遇有限而对学习和工作产生质疑(questioning)和不满（dissatisfaction)。第三段分析了教育方面的原因：日本“重视应试和机械学习、忽略创造力和自我表现力的培养”的教育方式给青少年带来巨大压力和挫败感。第四段通过but… more…这一转折递进结构，指出造成该现象的主要原因：日本生活方式的改变使得日本人容忍力降低。

**［正确项设置］** ［D］是第四段主旨的概括。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］偷梁换柱，将第二段①句中“青年人的社会机遇受到限制”改为“女性的社会活动受到限制”。［B］答非所问，将表现当作原因。［C］偷梁换柱，将第三段①句emphasis on the basics加上否定词excessive。

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| [A] Japanese education is praised for helping the   young climb the social ladder. | [A] 日本的教育受到称赞，因为它有助于年轻人攀登社会阶梯。 |
| [B] Japanese education is characterized by mechanical   learning as well as creativity. | [B] 日本教育以机械的学习和创造力为特征。                 |

| [D] Dropping out leads to frustration against test   taking. | [D] 辍学导致了应试的挫败感。                             |

本题考核的知识点是：作者观点。正确率：57%

**［快速解题］** 作者在第三段评价日本教育时，先批评其强调应试和机械性学习而不强调创造力和自我表达的培养，接着引用教育委员会主席的话指出，这导致了严重的不良后果：孩子们辍学，变得难以管教，校园暴力也很突出。由此可知，作者希望教育加强对学生的创造力和自我表达能力的培养。［C］正确。同时可以排除［B］。第三段首句提到，日本教育受到表扬是因为它强调基础教育, 排除［A］。［D］的因果关系颠倒了，文中提到的是应试的挫败感导致孩子们辍学。

**［篇章分析］** 第三段从教育方面分析了日本道德价值观沦落的原因。①句指出了日本教育的特点：对“应试和机械学习”的强调胜过对“创造性和自我表现”的培养。②③句引用教育委员会主席的话，指出这种教育特点存在的弊端及导致的严重后果：忽略了学生的个性、能力、勇气或人道（而这些对人的价值观有重大影响）；挫败感造成学生辍学、放荡不羁、暴力。④句用数据证明②③句的观点。⑤句指出日本保守的领导人针对这种情况提出的建议——恢复到战前强调道德教育的状况。⑥句指出持此观点的理由——战后美国占领当局引进的自由改革削弱了日本人的道德观。

**［正确项设置］** ［C］为第三段①②句的深层含义。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］将climbing Japan’s rigid social ladder（第二段首句）和often praised for (第三段首句)糅杂到一起形成干扰。［B］偷梁换柱，将“stress mechanical learning over creativity”改为“stress mechanical learning and creativity”。［D］颠倒第三段③句中Frustration … leads kids to drop out的因果关系。

本题考核的知识点是：具体细节。正确率：50%

**［快速解题］** 根据题干关键词life-style定位到第四段。该段④句指出，随着生活方式的改变，新一代的日本人不像从前那样愿意忍受生活中的不适（the discomfort is beginning to tell，tell意为“产生影响，显露出来”）。末句提到的离婚率和自杀率的上升就是不堪忍受的表现。可见，［A］是日本生活方式改变的表现。［B］与末句中“日本人的离婚率仍然低于美国人”的事实不符。［C］在文中未提及，文中只提到日本人的忍耐力减弱。［D］显然不对，否则就不会出现离婚率和自杀率的上升。

**［篇章分析］**第四段指出日本社会道德观沦丧的主要原因。①句为过渡句兼段落主旨句。承接前两段的原因分析，指出最主要的原因是日本生活方式的改变。②句援引教育家的话指出承受力的重要性。③④句指出了日本生活方式发生的改变：城市居住的集中造成人们的容忍性降低。⑤句指出了容忍性降低的表现：离婚率和自杀率上升。

**［正确项设置］** ［A］是第四段④句the discomfort is beginning to tell的同义改写，对该句的理解需要结合上下文及段落主旨。

**［干扰项设置］** 其他项反向干扰。［B］中exceeds对应⑤句中的still well below。［C］将第四段提到的“容忍性降低”改为“相比以前忍受更多”。［D］利用③句中in favor of（看重，选择）设置干扰，但该句只客观介绍“大家庭被两代之家取而代之”。

 

**三、句式结构分析**

1.Ten years ago young people were hardworking and saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don’t know where they should go next.

该句由but连接的两个并列分句构成。“十年前，年轻人工作努力，将工作看做是生存的首要动力。然而，目前日本在很大程度上已经满足其经济发展的需要，年轻人反而不知道下一步的发展目标”。这种现象对中国亦有借鉴作用。例：More than thirty years ago, our parent generation worked hard and saw revolutionary ideal as their primary reason for being, but now China has largely developed its economy and improved its people’s living standards, and a few of young people don’t know what they really strive for.三十多年前，我们的父辈努力工作，把革命理想看作他们生存的首要原因，但是现在，中国经济有了长足的发展，人民生活也有了很大改善，一些年轻人却不明白为什么而奋斗。

2.The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job market have limited the opportunities of teenagers who are already questioning the heavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan’s rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs.

该句很长，因为后置修饰成分很多。该句主干是The coming...and an entry...limited the opportunities of teenagers...。并列主语中的名词age和entry后都有of短语做定语，宾语中teenagers后跟着who引导的定语从句，从句中的名词sacrifices后面跟着的过去分词involved in... 做它的定语。

3.“Those things that do not show up in the test scores-personality, ability, courage or humanity are completely ignored,” says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s education committee.

“那些在考试分数中不能表现的东西——个性、能力、勇气和人性——被完全忽视了”,这是执政的自由民主党教育委员会主席的话。他的话也适用中国的国情：考试不能代表一切，还有很多更重要的东西。

 

**四、全文翻译**

毫无目标几乎不是战后日本的特色，相反，其生产率与社会的和谐程度为美国和欧洲所羡慕。但是，日本人正在经历传统工作道德价值观的日益衰退。**10年前，日本年轻人工作勤奋，将工作视为他们存在的主要理由，但现在日本的经济需求已经大体上得到了满足，因此年轻人不知道他们下一步何去何从。**（句式1）

**战后生育高峰期的到来，以及女性进入由男性主导的就业市场，都限制了青少年的发展机遇，这些青少年已经开始质疑在为了进好学校，找好工作，而攀登日本等级森严的社会阶梯的过程中所付出的沉重的个人代价是否值得。**（句式2）最近的一次调查发现，与62.7%的美国学生相比较，只有24.5%的日本学生对学校生活完全满意。此外，与被调查的其他10个国家的工人相比，对自身工作表示不满的日本工人数量要多得多。

虽然日本重视基础教育而经常受到外国人的赞扬，但是它往往强调应试和机械的学习，而不重视创造性和自我表现的培养。**“考分反映不出的那些东西——个性、能力、勇气或人道——完全被忽视，”执政的自民党教育委员会主席Toshiki Kaifu说，**（句式3）“这种情况带来的挫败感，致使孩子们辍学、放荡不羁。”去年日本发生了2 125起校园暴力事件，其中包括929起攻击老师事件。在一片抗议声中，许多保守的领导人正在力图恢复战前强调道德教育的状况。去年，时任教育大臣的Mitsuo Setoyama就提出责难，他认为二战后美国占领当局引进的自由改革削弱了“日本人尊敬父母的道德观”。

但是，这也许与日本人的生活方式关系更大。教育家Yoko Muro说，“在日本，你是否喜欢自己的工作和生活从来不是问题，问题仅仅是你能承受多大的负荷。”随着经济的发展，居住集中化也接踵而至，在日本一亿一千九百万人当中，足有76%的人生活在城市，社区和几世同堂的大家庭已经成为过去，取而代之的是单门独户的两代之家。城市里的日本人长期忍受着漫长的上下班来回路程和拥挤不堪的居住条件，但是，随着传统的群体和家庭价值观念的削弱，这种不舒适开始突显出来。在过去10年中，日本的离婚率，尽管仍远在美国之下，却也已经上升了50%多，而自杀率则上升了近1/4。

**［快速解题］**  文章开篇指出，若要雄心壮志被正确看待，那么它带来的回报——财富、声誉、对自己命运的掌控——应该被认为使人们值得为实现抱负而做出牺牲。［A］正确。［B］只提了雄心壮志带来的回报，没有将它与“为实现抱负作出牺牲”联系起来，含义不完整。［C］与文意不符，雄心壮志的目标也包括物质，如：财富。［D］文中未提，该段②句只提到“人们应当广泛地拥有（widely shared）雄心壮志这种传统”。

**［篇章分析］** 第一段①②句指出如何才能正确看待雄心壮志，两个句子使用平行结构：If ambition is to…If the tradition of ambition is to …实现了句间的衔接。①句指出，必须把为了得到雄心壮志的回报而作出的各种牺牲看作是值得的。②句进而指出，雄心壮志必须受到人们，尤其是包括受教育者在内的成功人士的广泛的推崇。该句采用it must...it especially must... not least的递进结构引出了推广雄心壮志的关键人群：the educated，从而与下文更好地衔接。③④句转而指出了受教育人士相反的做法：虽然从雄心壮志中受益匪浅却宣称已经放弃了雄心壮志。⑤句为全文主旨句，利用比喻的修辞手法揭示了受教育者这一行为的虚伪性。

**［正确项设置］** ［A］为第一段①句的同义改写，its returns对应句中的the rewards of ambition；well compensate for对应be deemed worthy of。

**［干扰项设置］** ［B］只截取了①句的部分内容the rewards of ambition—wealth, distinction, control over one’s destiny。［C］曲解原意，将①句提到的“雄心壮志带来的物质和精神的回报”曲解为“目标只有精神上的”。［D］利用②句中个别词汇shared设置无关干扰。

本题考核的知识点是：句意。正确率：39%

**［快速解题］** 首段末句先指出受教育者行为的虚伪性，接着以“马已经跑了再关上马厩的门”这一生动的比方揭露受教育者“从雄心壮志中收益匪浅，却声称要放弃雄心壮志”的虚伪本质。二者相同之处在于均是虚伪的行为，其中，horses代表ambition，riding代表ambition带来的好处。［C］概括了这种虚伪性。

**［正确项设置］** 第一段末句以打比方作为论据，［C］是它要论证的观点。其中dishonest对应⑤句中hypocrisy，deny ambition after the fulfilment of the goal是⑤句this所指代的内容，也是③④句内容的概括。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］只提及部分事实。遗漏了“受教育者从野心中获益匪浅”这个重要内容，不足以体现其虚伪性。［B］望文生义，由末句closing the barn door after the horses have escaped联想到谚语lock the barn door after the horse is stolen（亡羊补牢，为时已晚），没有结合上下文来理解。［D］利用文中个别词汇benefits, ambition设置无关干扰。

**［快速解题］** 第二段③句指出，人们不能像以前那样轻易地、公开地坦陈自己的梦想（即承认有雄心壮志），惟恐别人认为自己爱出风头、贪得无厌、庸俗不堪（pushing, acquisitive and vulgar）。由此可知［D］正确。［A］文中未提及。第二段首句提到，“人们对成功及其标志的兴趣丝毫未减”，可见，［B］、［C］与事实相反。

**［篇章分析］ 第**二段进一步阐述第一段末提出的观点“受教育者宣称放弃雄心壮志的做法有着浓重的虚伪色彩”。①句首先否定了宣称放弃雄心壮志是因为对成功及其标志的兴趣减少。②用人们依然在追求象征成功的物质的事实支持①句观点。③句进而指出他们不愿承认心怀雄心壮志的真正原因：害怕被别人认为自己贪得无厌、庸俗不堪。④句列举了现实生活中的虚伪做法。⑤句揭露这些做法的虚伪性：一方面享受着雄心壮志带来的成功，另一方面却避免表现出雄心壮志。

**［正确项设置］** 题干和正确项是第二段③句的同义改写。［D］将原句中的三个形容词替换为greedy and contemptible，题干用openly admit they have ambition同义替换句中confess fully to their dreams easily and openly。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］偷换概念，将③句中“被别人认为爱出风头等”偷换成“自己认为是不道德的”。［B］、［C］反向干扰，对应第二段①句people do not seem less interested in success and its signs。由②句可知，its signs 主要指fame and wealth，因此，雄心壮志和物质利益密切相关，人们追求它们的热忱丝毫未减。

本题考核的知识点是：推理引申。正确率：34%

**［快速解题］** 最后一段谈到人们对雄心壮志的攻击远多于对它的维护，因此本应是一种健康公开的品质却得不到很多支持。不公开表达雄心壮志带来的后果是迫使雄心壮志转入地下，或暗藏于胸。由此我们可推知，人们不应该隐瞒自己的雄心壮志。此外，纵观全文，作者提倡的是正确看待雄心壮志，坦言自己的抱负。［B］恰是此意。［A］secretly是作者谴责的方式；［C］文中未提到；［D］没有涉及作者提倡的方式：公开地、积极地。

**［篇章分析］**第三段①句承接上文介绍的对待雄心壮志的虚伪做法，指出雄心壮志受到的不公正对待：受到的攻击多；得到的维护少。②至④句指出这种情况造成的后果。该部分运用As a result,… This doesn’t mean that…but only that…Consequences follow from this…这一正反交织的论证结构指出了目前的情况：雄心壮志虽依然起到激励人们的作用，但却得不到公开支持，而是被迫转入地下。⑤句总结指出现在人们对待雄心壮志的三种态度。

**［正确项设置］** 正确项信息暗含于末段②至④句。一方面，作者指出人们不敢坦诚心怀雄心壮志（less openly，no longer openly，underground和sly）；另一方面，作者又对雄心壮志高度赞扬（a healthy impulse，a quality to be admired，its stirrings and promptings）。［B］是作者观点的概括。

**［干扰项设置］** ［A］反向干扰，secretly对应④句中sly,是作者反对的观点。［C］无中生有。［D］利用文中词语impulse，in the mind of，openly professed设置无关干扰。

 

**三、句式结构分析**

1.If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition—wealth, distinction, control over one’s destiny-must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition’s behalf.

此句主干是If..., the rewards of ambition...must be deemed worthy of ...。其中if引导的是条件状语从句；破折号中的wealth, distinction, control over one’s destiny既是插入成分，又是the rewards of ambition的同位语，起解释说明的作用；made on ambition’s behalf是sacrifices的定语。worthy of 意思是“值得，不辜负”；on one’s behalf意思是“为了”。

2.If the tradition of ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it especially must be highly regarded by people who are themselves admired, the educated not least among them.

该句的主干是If..., it must be... ; and it especially must be... by... 。分号前后是两个分句，前一个分句是含if条件句的主从复合句，其主句为被动语态。后一个分句同样是被动语态，其中who引导的定语从句修饰people，从句后是一个独立主格结构作补充说明。regard sb/sth（with sth）意为“将某人、某事物视为，认为某事物是”，这里highly regard表示“很受重视”，例：your work is highly regarded. 你的工作很受重视。

3.Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly. Summer homes, European travel, BMWs—the locations, place names and name brands may change, but such items do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago.

句子主干是people do not...和...may change, but... do not。这两句话并不难理解，考生关键是要理解do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly和do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago这两个双重否定的比较级，意思是“丝毫不…，一点都不比…时候…”。

4.What has happened is that people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily and openly as once they could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and vulgar. 

what引导的名词从句做主语，that引导的从句作表语，as...as...结构意为“像…一样”，修饰表语从句中的谓语confess。lest意为“惟恐、以免”，后面接的句子用虚拟语气（should）do，例：He ran away let he （should/might） be seen.（他跑开了，以免被人看见）。think sb /sth+a.意为“认为某人或某事物怎样”，例：You must think me very silly.（你肯定认为我很蠢）。

5.Instead, we are treated to fine hypocritical spectacles, which now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic of American materialism with a Southampton summer home; the publisher of radical books who takes his meals in three-star restaurants; the journalist advocating participatory democracy in all phases of life, whose own children are enrolled in private schools.

be treated to的意思是“被款待，被招待”，spectacles意为“壮观景象”，这里具有反讽意味。冒号后面三个并列名词性短语分别由with 引导的介词短语做定语，who引导的定语从句做定语和advocate的现在分词形式做定语，语言形式富于变化，无累赘乏味之感。

 

**四、全文翻译**

**如果要正确看待雄心壮志的话，那么它带来的回报——财富、声誉、对自己命运的掌控——则应该被认为是值得人们为实现抱负而做出牺牲的**。(句式1)**如果雄心壮志的传统要继续保持活力，那么它就应该受到广泛的推崇，尤其应该受到那些受人仰慕的人们的高度重视，而那些受过教育的人更应包括在内。**（句式2）然而，恰恰是那些受过教育的人却不可思议地声称他们已经放弃了雄心壮志壮志这一理想。奇怪的是他们或许已经从雄心壮志壮志中获益匪浅——如果不总是他们自己的雄心壮志，那么就是他们父辈或祖父辈的雄心壮志。这其中有着浓厚的虚伪色彩，恰如马跑后再关上马厩的门那样，而受过良好教育的人自己正骑在那些马背上。

**当然，与过去相比，现在人们对成功及其标志的兴趣丝毫未减。避暑别墅，欧洲旅行、宝马轿车——位置、地名和品牌可能会改变，但现在对这些东西的需求似乎并未比一二十年前有所减少。**（句式3）**现在的情况是人们不能像以前那样轻易地、公开地坦陈自己的梦想，惟恐别人认为自己爱出风头、贪得无厌、庸俗不堪。**（句式4）**相反，我们似乎目睹了比以往任何时候都多的虚伪景象：美国实利主义的批评家在南安普顿拥有避暑别墅；激进的出版商到三星级宾馆就餐；倡导终生共享民主制的新闻记者却把自己的子女送进私立学校。对于这样的人，及更多也许不这么出色的人而言，最好的诠释是“不惜一切代价获得成功，但避免表现出雄心勃勃”。**（句式5）

对雄心壮志的攻击非常之多，且出自各种不同的角度；公开为之辩解的则少之又少，虽不能说这些辩解毫无吸引力可言，但却未能给人们留下深刻印象。因此，在美国，雄心壮志作为一种健康的动力，一种应该令人称羡并扎根于青年人心灵的品质，它所得到的支持也许比以往任何时期都低。但这并不意味着雄心壮志已经穷途末路，人们再也感觉不到它的萌动和激励了，只是人们不再公开地以它为荣，更不愿公开地表白它了。当然由此产生的后果中的一些就是雄心壮志被迫转入地下，或暗藏于胸。于是，情况就成了这样：左边是愤怒的批评家，右边是愚蠢的支持者，而居中的通常是大多数认真而努力追求成功的人。

 

**Section IV: English-Chinese Translation (15 points)**

 

**一、文章结构分析**

本文从两个方面论述了现代政府在实施职能方面越来越依靠各个科学领域中的专家人才。一是政府依赖经济学、运筹学等领域的专家来干预经济，促进经济发展，从而增加人们的福利。二是由于人们产生新的需要、人口增长给改革增添了新的压力，从而使政府更加依赖生物学家和社会学家的决策。

2000年的翻译试题与往年相比较容易，考生的得分普遍较高。主要因为以下几个原因：（1）句子结构不太复杂，语法修饰关系比较清晰；（2）难理解的词汇少；（3）文章的背景知识简单，不造成理解障碍。具体而言，该部分主要考查了以下几点：逻辑词的翻译来体现句子内部逻辑；it is obvious that结构；被动语态、时态的翻译；多个因果分句的译法；带破折号的句子的译法；状语从句的译法。但是尽管本年翻译难度不大，依然有考生由于基础差的原因得分很低。因此考生在备考时，要着重从词汇和语法方面下手，加强基本功的练习。

 

**二、试题具体解析**

（31）Under modern conditions, this requires varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of specialized scientists such as economists and operational research experts. 

本题考核的知识点是：逻辑词的翻译。正确率：55%

**［句子结构］**  该句为简单句，其主干是：this requires varying measures and hence the help。谓语require带了两个宾语 measures 和the help。本句的难点是hence的译法，它在句中是承上启下起连接作用的逻辑词，表明上半句内容“这需要程度不同的集中控制措施”导致了后半句话的内容“需要获得专家的协助”，即前因后果关系。因此Hence可译为“从而，从此”。

**［词义确定］** varying意为“不同的”；operational research experts直译是“研究操作过程的科学家”，用术语翻译就是“运筹学专家”。

**［标准译文］** 在现代条件下，这需要程度不同的集中控制措施，从而就需要获得诸如经济学和运筹学等领域的专家的协助。

（32）Furthermore, it is obvious that the strength of a country’s economy is directly bound up with the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that this in turn rests upon the efforts of scientists and technologists of all kinds. 

本题考核的知识点是：it is obvious that结构，代词指代，逻辑词的翻译。正确率：65%

**［句子结构］**  该句子由两个并列的主语从句构成，其主干是 it is obvious that..., and that...。it为形式主语，真正主语是两个由and连接的that引导的从句。it is obvious that...经常译作“很显然”或“显而易见”。第二个that从句中的代词this指代第一个分句中的efficiency of its agriculture and industry（工农业的高效率），在翻译的时候应点明一下；in turn的英文释义为as a result of something，它表达的是一种递进关系，因此注意不能把两个从句只译成平行关系的句子，如：“两件事情很明显：一是…，二是…”。

**［词义确定］** bound up with的意为“与…密切相关”；in turn 意为“又，依次，转而”；rest upon意为to depend upon（依靠）。

**［标准译文］** 再者，显而易见的是一个国家的经济实力与其工农业生产效率密切相关，而效率的提高则又有赖于各种科技人员的努力。

（33）Owing to the remarkable development in mass communications, people everywhere are feeling new wants and are being exposed to new customs and ideas, while governments are often forced to introduce still further innovations for the reasons given above.

本题考核的知识点是：被动语态、时态的翻译、多个因果分句的译法。正确率：59%

**［句子结构］**  该句为复合句，其主干是people are feeling wants...and are being exposed to，其中含有两个并列的现在进行时态的谓语动词，英语中的现在进行时除了表示现在正在进行的动作之外，还可以表示一段时间内正在进行的动作，可用“不断…”来表示这层意思。句首介词短语owing to...（由于…）引导表原因的状语；主句后面while也引导伴随状语。翻译时关键要弄清三个分句的逻辑关系，即第一分句“大众通讯的显著发展”表原因，第二分句“人们不断感到有新的需求”是结果，而第三分句“政府推出更多的革新”则是上面两分句引起的结果。由于有两套因果关系，为避免两次出现“由于…”，原因状语owing to...结构可译成“…使，造成了”。

**［词义确定］** mass communication指报纸、电视、电台等具有广泛影响的大众传媒或通讯；want做名词，意为“缺乏，需要”；be exposed to是被动语态，基本意思是“被暴露于…”，可灵活译成“接触到…”；introduce 在句中和innovations搭配，应译作“实施，采取”，而不是“介绍、宣传”；further虽可表示距离，但修饰“改革”时表示“更进一步，更多的”； for the reasons given above意为“由于上述的原因”。

**［标准译文］** 大众通讯的显著发展使各地的人们不断感到有新的需求，不断接触到新的习俗和思想。由于上述原因，政府常常得推出更多的革新。

（34）in the early industrialized countries of Europe the process of industrialization—with all the far-reaching changes in social patterns that followed—was spread over nearly a century, whereas nowadays a developing nation may undergo the same process in a decade or so.

本题考核的知识点是：带破折号的句子的译法。正确率：62%

**［句子结构］**  该句为复合句，其主干是：the process...was spread..., whereas...。句子中出现了两个破折号，英语中的破折号大致相当于汉语中的括号，起一个补充的作用。理解的时候可以先把破折号中的部分略去不看，以便加强对此句的整体印象。翻译的时候看破折号之间的内容是否与前后联系紧密，才能够决定译文中用不用破折号。第一个破折号后with介宾结构表示伴随，可以译成“随之而来的”；其中紧跟在social patterns后的定语从句that followed修饰的是changes，而不是social patterns，因此far-reaching changes in social patterns that followed应该译成“随之而来的各种深刻的社会结构变革”。whereas表示转折，使前后形成对比，可以译作“而、可是”；the same process 是指前面的the process of industrialization（工业化进程）。

**［词义确定］** far-reaching指“深远，深刻，广泛的”，spread over意为“延续，持续”，undergo意为“经历，完成”，or so意为“左右”。

**［标准译文］** 在先期实现工业化的欧洲国家中，其工业化进程以及随之而来的各种深刻的社会结构变革，持续了大约一个世纪之久，而如今一个发展中国家在十年左右就可能完成这个过程。

(35) Additional social stresses may also occur because of the population explosion or problems arising from mass migration movements—themselves made relatively easy nowadays by modern means of transport.

本题考核的知识点是：破折号的作用、additional的译法和状语从句的译法。正确率：63%

**［句子结构］**  该句子的主干是 social stresses may also occur because of the population explosion or problems，because of 介词短语做原因状语。由于中文一般先说原因后说结果，因此翻译时可以把主句放在后面。arising from...修饰problems，意为“从…而起的问题”或“由于…而造成的问题”。破折号后themselves和过去分词made relatively easy一起是一个独立主格结构，起补充说明的作用，themselves指代前面的mass migration movements（大量的人口流动）。

**［词义确定］** social stresses指“社会压力”；occur意为“发生”；mass在这里指“大量的”。

**［标准译文］** 由于人口的猛增或人口的大量流动(现代交通工具使这种流动相对容易)造成的种种问题也会对社会造成新的压力。

 

**三、参考译文**

世界各国政府的行为都基于一个假设，即，本国人民的福利主要依赖于该国经济实力和社会财富。（31）**在现代条件下，这需要程度不同的集中控制措施，从而就需要获得诸如经济学和运筹学等领域的专家的协助**。（32）**再者，显而易见的是一个国家的经济实力与其工农业生产效率密切相关，而效率的提高则又有赖于各种科技人员的努力。**这也就意味着政府被迫越来越多地干预这些产业部门，以便提高生产率，确保产品的消费发挥最佳效益。例如，政府可能利用各种方法鼓励研究工作，包括建立自己的研究中心；政府可以改变教育结构，或进行干预，以便减少自然资源的浪费，开发尚未利用的资源；或者在日益增多的跨国科学、经济和工业项目中直接进行合作。无论如何，一切干预都离不开科学家的建议和各种科技人才。

**（33）大众通讯的显著发展使各地的人们不断感到有新的需求，不断接触到新的习俗和思想。由于上述原因，政府常常得推出更多的革新。**与此同时，与过去相比，世界各地社会变化的正常速度越来越快。例如，（34）**在先期实现工业化的欧洲国家中，其工业化进程以及随之而来的各种深刻的社会结构变革，持续了大约一个世纪之久，而如今一个发展中国家在十年左右就可能完成这个过程。**这一切带来的后果就是，在社会内部营造了异乎寻常的压力和紧张气氛，从而给有关政府带来了严重问题需要处理。（35）**由于人口的猛增或人口的大量流动(现代交通工具使这种流动相对容易)造成的种种问题也会对社会造成新的压力。**目前，以上所有这些因素产生的后果就是，各国政府为了制定合理的计划并将之付诸实施，越来越多地依靠生物学家和社会学家。

 

**Section** **ⅣWriting(15 points)**

 

**一、审题谋篇**

本题命题形式是图画式写作。该图片由上下两部分组成，展现的是对比关系。图片的主体是“船和鱼”，上部分的图片中，船有一艘，鱼则很多；而下部分图片则完全相反，船变得特别多，鱼却只有一条。图片上的“1900”和“1995”表明两部分展现的是不同时间段的不同景象。图片下面的标题“A history of world commercial fishing”揭示了图片所反映的现象的背景和原因。

分析图片后，接下来进行构思。根据题目要求，文章可以分为三部分写。第一部分对图片进行描写：因为两幅图形成的是一种鲜明的对比，描写时可采用对比的句式，注意表对比、转折的连接词的选用。第二部分分析画者的意图：结合图片及标题可知画者在揭示大肆捕捞使得海洋鱼类资源迅速减少的现象。进一步剖析，则可得出图片传达的深层含义是批判人类对自然资源的滥用，如果透过现象，分析原因，还可以得出：这一切破坏的根源是商业利益的驱使。第三部分提出相应的解决方案，需要列出具体可行的措施和建议。具体建议可以从负责部门和普通个人的角度分别提出。需要注意的是本文字数限制为150字左右，因此观点表达应力求简单明了。

 

**二、参考范文**

A big contrast is shown in the picture. In 1900 there was only one ship in the sea rich in fish, while in 1995, there became only one fish in the sea crowded with ships. The caption demonstrates that it was the ever-developing fishing industry that caused the **devastating** effects on the fishing resource.

The picture **conveys** a deep concern about the ecological disaster which is being brought about by the over-fishing driven by short-term commercial interests. It also **implies** a more worrisome consequence. The profit-oriented behavior may **penetrate** into other fields, which results in the abuse of more resources.

To solve this concern, we should **spare no efforts** in protecting natural resources. Laws should be enforced to **prohibit** the actions of blind exploitation, such as over-fishing in this picture. In addition, people should be educated to realize the value of these resources and voluntarily protect them.

**四、写作误区**

篇章结构误区：

考生在主题把握上出现偏差，其原因如下：一，受惯有思维的影响。一些考生看到图片表现了鱼类资源减少，就想当然地把这一现象与pollution联系到了一起，从而大谈环境污染的坏处以及控制的措施。二，审题不全面。有些考生只看了图片的文字，通篇只写捕鱼业的历史。或者忽视图片文字，只谈渔类资源减少，避而不谈捕鱼业在其中的影响。三，立意狭隘。部分考生停留在现象的表面，对图片仅进行了初步分析，而对现象的来龙去脉以及其中蕴含的深刻的因果关系没有进行剖析。比如有些考生只得出“船多了鱼就少了”这种表面的联系，从而仅仅提出限制渔船数量的建议。

Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Then mark your answer on **ANSWER SHEET 1** by blackening the corresponding letter in the brackets with a pencil. (40 points)

**Text 1**

It’s a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a leg slipping on your doormat. Light up the stove and you could burn down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to warn of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for your troubles. Or so the thinking has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began holding more companies liable for their customers’ misfortunes.

Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to anticipate every possible accident. Today, stepladders carry labels several inches long that warn, among other things, that you might -- surprise! -- fall off. The label on a child’s Batman cape cautions that the toy “does not enable user to fly.”

While warnings are often appropriate and necessary -- the dangers of drug interactions, for example -- and many are required by state or federal regulations, it isn’t clear that they actually protect the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. About 50 percent of the companies lose when injured customers take them to court.

Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue as before, some courts are beginning to side with defendants, especially in cases where a warning label probably wouldn’t have changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt Sports in Illinois, successfully fought a lawsuit involving a football player who was paralyzed in a game while wearing a Schutt helmet. “We’re really sorry he has become paralyzed, but helmets aren’t designed to prevent those kinds of injuries,” says Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature of the game, not the helmet, was the reason for the athlete’s injury. At the same time, the American Law Institute -- a group of judges, lawyers, and academics whose recommendations carry substantial weight -- issued new guidelines for tort law stating that companies need not warn customers of obvious dangers or bombard them with a lengthy list of possible ones. “Important information can get buried in a sea of trivialities,” says a law professor at Cornell law School who helped draft the new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal community has its way, the information on products might actually be provided for the benefit of customers and not as protection against legal liability.

\51. What were things like in 1980s when accidents happened?

[A] Customers might be relieved of their disasters through lawsuits.

[B] Injured customers could expect protection from the legal system.

[C] Companies would avoid being sued by providing new warnings.（B）

[D] Juries tended to find fault with the compensations companies promised.

\52. Manufacturers as mentioned in the passage tend to ________.

[A] satisfy customers by writing long warnings on products

[B] become honest in describing the inadequacies of their products

[C] make the best use of labels to avoid legal liability（C）

[D] feel obliged to view customers’ safety as their first concern

\53. The case of Schutt helmet demonstrated that ________.

[A] some injury claims were no longer supported by law

[B] helmets were not designed to prevent injuries

[C] product labels would eventually be discarded（A）

[D] some sports games might lose popularity with athletes

\54. The author’s attitude towards the issue seems to be ________.

[A] biased

[B] indifferent

[C] puzzling（D）

[D] objective

 

**Text 2**

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to tap the consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies have started to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such business-to-business sales make sense because businesspeople typically know what product they’re looking for.

Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its reliability. “Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them and the supplier,” says senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are limiting the risk by conducting online transactions only with established business partners who are given access to the company’s private intranet.

Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available for marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to “pull” customers into sites. In the past year, however, software companies have developed tools that allow companies to “push” information directly out to consumers, transmitting marketing messages directly to targeted customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen saver to deliver a continually updated stream of news and advertisements to subscribers’ computer monitors. Subscribers can customize the information they want to receive and proceed directly to a company’s Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are already starting to use similar technologies to push messages to customers about special sales, product offerings, or other events. But push technology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online culture thinks highly of the notion that the information flowing onto the screen comes there by specific request. Once commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction between the Web and television fades. That’s a prospect that horrifies Net purists.

But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies to make money. The examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show that a Web site selling the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, hospitality, and security will attract online customers. And the cost of computing power continues to free fall, which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon. People looking back 5 or 10 years from now may well wonder why so few companies took the online plunge.

\55. We learn from the beginning of the passage that Web business ________.

[A] has been striving to expand its market

[B] intended to follow a fanciful fashion

[C] tried but in vain to control the market（A）

[D] has been booming for one year or so

 

\56. Speaking of the online technology available for marketing, the author implies that ________.

[A] the technology is popular with many Web users

[B] businesses have faith in the reliability of online transactions

[C] there is a radical change in strategy（C）

[D] it is accessible limitedly to established partners

\57. In the view of Net purists, ________.

[A] there should be no marketing messages in online culture

[B] money making should be given priority to on the Web

[C] the Web should be able to function as the television set（D）

[D] there should be no online commercial information without requests

\58. We learn from the last paragraph that ________.

[A] pushing information on the Web is essential to Internet commerce

[B] interactivity, hospitality and security are important to online customers

[C] leading companies began to take the online plunge decades ago（B）

[D] setting up shops in silicon is independent of the cost of computing power

An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the classroom on the behalf of students’ career prospects and those arguing for computers in the classroom for broader reasons of radical educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have explored this distinction -- indeed, contradiction -- which goes to the heart of what is wrong with the campaign to put computers in the classroom.

An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of job is a technical education, justified for reasons radically different from why education is universally required by law. It is not simply to raise everyone’s job prospects that all children are legally required to attend school into their teens. Rather, we have a certain conception of the American citizen, a character who is incomplete if he cannot competently assess how his livelihood and happiness are affected by things outside of himself. But this was not always the case; before it was legally required for all children to attend school until a certain age, it was widely accepted that some were just not equipped by nature to pursue this kind of education. With optimism characteristic of all industrialized countries, we came to accept that everyone is fit to be educated. Computer-education advocates forsake this optimistic notion for a pessimism that betrays their otherwise cheery outlook. Banking on the confusion between educational and vocational reasons for bringing computers into schools, computered advocates often emphasize the job prospects of graduates over their educational achievement.

There are some good arguments for a technical education given the right kind of student. Many European schools introduce the concept of professional training early on in order to make sure children are properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It is, however, presumptuous to insist that there will only be so many jobs for so many scientists, so many businessmen, so many accountants. Besides, this is unlikely to produce the needed number of every kind of professional in a country as large as ours and where the economy is spread over so many states and involves so many international corporations.

But, for a small group of students, professional training might be the way to go since well-developed skills, all other factors being equal, can be the difference between having a job and not. Of course, the basics of using any computer these days are very simple. It does not take a lifelong acquaintance to pick up various software programs. If one wanted to become a computer engineer, that is, of course, an entirely different story. Basic computer skills take -- at the very longest -- a couple of months to learn. In any case, basic computer skills are only complementary to the host of real skills that are necessary to becoming any kind of professional. It should be observed, of course, that no school, vocational or not, is helped by a confusion over its purpose.

\59. The author thinks the present rush to put computers in the classroom is ________.

[A] far-reaching

[B] dubiously oriented

[C] self-contradictory（B）

[D] radically reformatory

\60. The belief that education is indispensable to all children ________.

[A] is indicative of a pessimism in disguise

[B] came into being along with the arrival of computers

[C] is deeply rooted in the minds of computered advocates（D）

[D] originated from the optimistic attitude of industrialized countries

\61. It could be inferred from the passage that in the author’s country the European model of professional training is ________.

[A] dependent upon the starting age of candidates

[B] worth trying in various social sections

[C] of little practical value（C）

[D] attractive to every kind of professional

\62. According to the author, basic computer skills should be ________.

[A] included as an auxiliary course in school

[B] highlighted in acquisition of professional qualifications

[C] mastered through a life-long course（A）

[D] equally emphasized by any school, vocational or otherwise

When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months ago that it had cloned an adult sheep, President Clinton moved swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this unusual animal husbandry technique to clone humans, he ordered that federal funds not be used for such an experiment -- although no one had proposed to do so -- and asked an independent panel of experts chaired by Princeton President Harold Shapiro to report back to the White House in 90 days with recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. That group -- the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) -- has been working feverishly to put its wisdom on paper, and at a meeting on 17 May, members agreed on a near-final draft of their recommendations.

NBAC will ask that Clinton’s 90-day ban on federal funds for human cloning be extended indefinitely, and possibly that it be made law. But NBAC members are planning to word the recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research that involves the cloning of human DNA or cells -- routine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet reached agreement on a crucial question, however, whether to recommend legislation that would make it a crime for private funding to be used for human cloning.

In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro suggested that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be “morally unacceptable to attempt to create a human child by adult nuclear cloning.” Shapiro explained during the meeting that the moral doubt stems mainly from fears about the risk to the health of the child. The panel then informally accepted several general conclusions, although some details have not been settled.

NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government funding for any attempt to clone body cell nuclei to create a child. Because current federal law already forbids the use of federal funds to create embryos (the earliest stage of human offspring before birth) for research or to knowingly endanger an embryo’s life, NBAC will remain silent on embryo research.

NBAC members also indicated that they will appeal to privately funded researchers and clinics not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were divided on whether to go further by calling for a federal law that would impose a complete ban on human cloning. Shapiro and most members favored an appeal for such legislation, but in a phone interview, he said this issue was still “up in the air.”

 

\63. We can learn from the first paragraph that ________.

[A] federal funds have been used in a project to clone humans

[B] the White House responded strongly to the news of cloning

[C] NBAC was authorized to control the misuse of cloning technique（B）

[D] the White House has got the panel’s recommendations on cloning

\64. The panel agreed on all of the following except that ________.

[A] the ban on federal funds for human cloning should be made a law

[B] the cloning of human DNA is not to be put under more control

[C] it is criminal to use private funding for human cloning（C）

[D] it would be against ethical values to clone a human being

\65. NBAC will leave the issue of embryo research undiscussed because ________.

[A] embryo research is just a current development of cloning

[B] the health of the child is not the main concern of embryo research

[C] an embryo’s life will not be endangered in embryo research（D）

[D] the issue is explicitly stated and settled in the law

\66. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that ________.

[A] some NBAC members hesitate to ban human cloning completely

[B] a law banning human cloning is to be passed in no time

[C] privately funded researchers will respond positively to NBAC’s appeal（A）

[D] the issue of human cloning will soon be settled

Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it prepares than on the preparedness of the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton supposedly discovered gravity through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in many places for centuries and thousands of people had seen them fall. But Newton for years had been curious about the cause of the orbital motion of the moon and planets. What kept them in place? Why didn’t they fall out of the sky? The fact that the apple fell down toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the question he had been asking himself about those larger fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.

How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the tree? Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind was ready for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research. If you don’t have unpredictable things, you don’t have research. Scientists tend to forget this when writing their cut and dried reports for the technical journals, but history is filled with examples of it.

In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression that they find the “scientific method” a substitute for imaginative thought. I’ve attended research conferences where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the advisability of continuing a certain experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at the graphs, and said “the data are still inconclusive.” “We know that,” the men from the budget office have said, “but what do you think? Is it worthwhile going on? What do you think we might expect?” The scientist has been shocked at having even been asked to speculate.

What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the victim of his own writings. He has put forward unquestioned claims so consistently that he not only believes them himself, but has convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If experiments are planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the science journals indicate, then it is perfectly logical for management to expect research to produce results measurable in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable for auditors to believe that scientists who know exactly where they are going and how they will get there should not be distracted by the necessity of keeping one eye on the cash register while the other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect, is management to be blamed for discriminating against the “odd balls” among researchers in favor of more conventional thinkers who “work well with the team.”

[A] inquiring minds are more important than scientific experiments

[B] science advances when fruitful researches are conducted

[C] scientists seldom forget the essential nature of research（A）

[A] have a keen interest in prediction

[B] often speculate on the future

[A] may not be as profitable as they are expected

[B] can be measured in dollars and cents

**Directions:**

Read the following passage carefully and then translate underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written clearly on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (15 points)

71) While there are almost as many definitions of history as there are historians, modern practice most closely conforms to one that sees history as the attempt to recreate and explain the significant events of the past. Caught in the web of its own time and place, each generation of historians determines anew what is significant for it in the past. In this search the evidence found is always incomplete and scattered; it is also frequently partial or partisan. The irony of the historian’s craft is that its practitioners always know that their efforts are but contributions to an unending process.

72) Interest in historical methods has arisen less through external challenge to the validity of history as an intellectual discipline and more from internal quarrels among historians themselves. While history once revered its affinity to literature and philosophy, the emerging social sciences seemed to afford greater opportunities for asking new questions and providing rewarding approaches to an understanding of the past. Social science methodologies had to be adapted to a discipline governed by the primacy of historical sources rather than the imperatives of the contemporary world. 73) During this transfer, traditional historical methods were augmented by additional methodologies designed to interpret the new forms of evidence in the historical study.

Methodology is a term that remains inherently ambiguous in the historical profession. 74) There is no agreement whether methodology refers to the concepts peculiar to historical work in general or to the research techniques appropriate to the various branches of historical inquiry. Historians, especially those so blinded by their research interests that they have been accused of “tunnel method,” frequently fall victim to the “technicist fallacy.” Also common in the natural sciences, the technicist fallacy mistakenly identifies the discipline as a whole with certain parts of its technical implementation.

75) It applies equally to traditional historians who view history as only the external and internal criticism of sources, and to social science historians who equate their activity with specific techniques.

The two graphs tell us something about population growth and wildlife extinction in the U.S. From 1800, the American population has been growing all the time. In the 100 years from 1600 to 1700, the number of wildlife species remained almost stable, with the next 200 years witnessing a growing trend in wildlife extinction. It can be easily seen that the more the human beings, the fewer the animal species.

There may be several reasons for this effect. First, as human population expands, more and more wild animals are hunted for food. Second, due to all kinds of pollution and the damage of ecosystem caused by man, some animals have nowhere to live. Third, some animals are of great medical value, they become the targets for making money.

It is time we took some measures to stop this disturbing trend. On one hand, government should pass some laws and regulations to prevent people from killing more wild animals and forbid further damage to our environment. On the other hand, we should cultivate the awareness that animals are our friends and their extinction poses a threat rather than brings benefits to us. Only when human beings live in harmony with all kinds of animals can we really build a beautiful and healthy world.

Until recently most historians spoke very critically of the Industrial Revolution. They  that in the long run industrialization greatly raised the standard of living for the  man. But they insisted that its  results during the period from 1750 to 1850 were widespread poverty and misery for the  of the English population.  contrast, they saw in the preceding hundred years from 1650 to 1750, when England was still a  agricultural country, a period of great abundance and prosperity.

This view, , is generally thought to be wrong. Specialists  history and economics, have  two things: that the period from 1650 to 1750 was  by great poverty, and that industrialization certainly did not worsen and may have actually improved the conditions for the majority of the populace.

**Text 1**

Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is humankind’s long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the idea of forcing the waters to do our bidding so fascinating. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind. Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good.

The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn’t help that building a big, powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to assert themselves. Egypt’s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam. Turkey’s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.

But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example, stopped the Nile flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left -- all in return for a giant reservoir of disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.

And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized Europe, Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of big dams. But Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs a dam to prove itself.

Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go-ahead to the even more wrong-headed Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will cause hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the powerful, but they are far from guaranteed.

Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of controlling water can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are possible without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it is hard to be either proper, or scientific. It is time that the world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don’t need a dam to be saved.

\51. The third sentence of Paragraph 1 implies that ________.

[A] people would be happy if they shut their eyes to reality

[B] the blind could be happier than the sighted

[C] over-excited people tend to neglect vital things（C）

[D] fascination makes people lose their eyesight

\52. In Paragraph 5, “the powerless” probably refers to ________.

[A] areas short of electricity

[B] dams without power stations

[C] poor countries around India（D）

[D] common people in the Narmada Dam area

\53. What is the myth concerning giant dams?

[A] They bring in more fertile soil.

[B] They help defend the country.

[C] They strengthen international ties.（D）

[D] They have universal control of the waters.

[A] “It’s no use crying over spilt milk”

[B] “More haste, less speed”

[C] “Look before you leap”（C）

**Text 2**

Well, no gain without pain, they say. But what about pain without gain? Everywhere you go in America, you hear tales of corporate revival. What is harder to establish is whether the productivity revolution that businessmen assume they are presiding over is for real.

The official statistics are mildly discouraging. They show that, if you lump manufacturing and services together, productivity has grown on average by 1.2% since 1987. That is somewhat faster than the average during the previous decade. And since 1991, productivity has increased by about 2% a year, which is more than twice the 1978-87 average. The trouble is that part of the recent acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this point in a business cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying trend. There is, as Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, says, a “disjunction” between the mass of business anecdote that points to a leap in productivity and the picture reflected by the statistics.

Some of this can be easily explained. New ways of organizing the workplace -- all that re-engineering and downsizing -- are only one contribution to the overall productivity of an economy, which is driven by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment and machinery, new technology, and investment in education and training. Moreover, most of the changes that companies make are intended to keep them profitable, and this need not always mean increasing productivity: switching to new markets or improving quality can matter just as much.

Two other explanations are more speculative. First, some of the business restructuring of recent years may have been ineptly done. Second, even if it was well done, it may have spread much less widely than people suppose.

Leonard Schlesinger, a Harvard academic and former chief executive of Au Bong Pain, a rapidly growing chain of bakery cafes, says that much “re-engineering” has been crude. In many cases, he believes, the loss of revenue has been greater than the reductions in cost. His colleague, Michael Beer, says that far too many companies have applied re-engineering in a mechanistic fashion, chopping out costs without giving sufficient thought to long-term profitability. BBDO’s Al Rosenshine is blunter. He dismisses a lot of the work of re-engineering consultants as mere rubbish -- “the worst sort of ambulance chasing.”

[A] not as good as it seems

[B] at its turning point

[C] much better than it seems（A）

[A] exclude the usual rebound in a business cycle

[B] fall short of businessmen’s anticipation

[C] meet the expectation of business people（B）

[D] fail to reflect the true state of economy

\57. The author raises the question “what about pain without gain?” because ________.

[A] he questions the truth of “no gain without pain”

[B] he does not think the productivity revolution works

[C] he wonders if the official statistics are misleading（B）

[D] he has conclusive evidence for the revival of businesses

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of *Gallileo’s* 17th-century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake’s harsh remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism between science and the humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.

Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore its critics -- but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have attacked “anti-science” in several books, notably *Higher Superstition*, by Paul R. Gross, a biologist at the University of Virginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers University; and *The Demon-Haunted World*, by Carl Sagan of Cornell University.

Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as “The Flight from Science and Reason,” held in New York City in 1995, and “Science in the Age of (Mis) information,” which assembled last June near Buffalo.

Anti-science clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find fault primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned science’s objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.

A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the anti-science tag has been attached to many other groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.

Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, whose manifesto, published in 1995, scorns science and longs for return to a pre-technological utopia. But surely that does not mean environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are anti-science, as an essay in *US News & World Report* last May seemed to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science, argues Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question the evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other consequences of industrial growth.

Indeed, some observers fear that the anti-science epithet is in danger of becoming meaningless. “The term ‘anti-science’ can lump together too many, quite different things,” notes Harvard University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work *Science and Anti-Science*. “They have in common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard themselves as more enlightened.”

Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing more and more regional competition, as population growth in the Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill.

This development -- and its strong implications for US politics and economy in years ahead -- has enthroned the South as America’s most densely populated region for the first time in the history of the nation’s head counting.

Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million people -- numerically the third-largest growth ever recorded in a single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4 percent, lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.

Americans have been migrating south and west in larger numbers since World War II, and the pattern still prevails.

Three sun-belt states -- Florida, Texas and California -- together had nearly 10 million more people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th and San Antonio from 15th to 10th -- with Cleveland and Washington. D. C., dropping out of the top 10.

Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow belt, census officials say. Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too -- and so did bigger crops of babies as yesterday’s “baby boom” generation reached its child-bearing years.

Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a related but newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for places with more jobs but with fewer people, too. Some instances—

■Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid growth rate -- 37.1 percent since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population.

■Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1 percent respectively. Except for Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is composed of Western states with 7.5 million people -- about 9 per square mile.

The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow belt to more bearable climates.

Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious living than in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, more than any other state.

In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, mostly to other parts of the West. Often they chose -- and still are choosing -- somewhat colder climates such as Oregon, Idaho and Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization in the Golden State.

As a result, California’s growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 18.5 percent -- little more than two thirds the 1960s’ growth figure and considerably below that of other Western states.

\63. Discerned from the perplexing picture of population growth the 1980 census provided, America in 1970s ________.

[A] enjoyed the lowest net growth of population in history

[B] witnessed a southwestern shift of population

[C] underwent an unparalleled period of population growth（B）

[D] brought to a standstill its pattern of migration since World War II

\64. The census distinguished itself from previous studies on population movement in that ________.

[A] it stresses the climatic influence on population distribution

[B] it highlights the contribution of continuous waves of immigrants

[C] it reveals the Americans’ new pursuit of spacious living（C）

[D] it elaborates the delayed effects of yesterday’s “baby boom”

\65. We can see from the available statistics that ________.

[A] California was once the most thinly populated area in the whole US

[B] the top 10 states in growth rate of population were all located in the West

[C] cities with better climates benefited unanimously from migration（D）

[D] Arizona ranked second of all states in its growth rate of population

\66. The word “demographers” (Line 1, Paragraph 8) most probably means ________.

[A] people in favor of the trend of democracy

[B] advocates of migration between states

[C] scientists engaged in the study of population（C）

[D] conservatives clinging to old patterns of life

**Text 5**

Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity known to geologists as hot spots. Unlike most of the world’s volcanoes, they are not always found at the boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up the earth’s surface; on the contrary, many of them lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the hot spots move only slowly, and in some cases the movement of the plates past them has left trails of dead volcanoes. The hot spots and their volcanic trails are milestones that mark the passage of the plates.

That the plates are moving is now beyond dispute. Africa and South America, for example, are moving away from each other as new material is injected into the sea floor between them. The complementary coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the ocean are reminders of where the two continents were once joined. The relative motion of the plates carrying these continents has been constructed in detail, but the motion of one plate with respect to another cannot readily be translated into motion with respect to the earth’s interior. It is not possible to determine whether both continents are moving in opposite directions or whether one continent is stationary and the other is drifting away from it. Hot spots, anchored in the deeper layers of the earth, provide the measuring instruments needed to resolve the question. From an analysis of the hot-spot population it appears that the African plate is stationary and that it has not moved during the past 30 million years.

The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role as a frame of reference. It now appears that they also have an important influence on the geophysical processes that propel the plates across the globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, the material rising from deeper layers creates a broad dome. As the dome grows, it develops deep fissures (cracks); in at least a few cases the continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, so that the hot spot initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus just as earlier theories have explained the mobility of the continents, so hot spots may explain their mutability (inconstancy).

\67. The author believes that ________.

[A] the motion of the plates corresponds to that of the earth’s interior

[B] the geological theory about drifting plates has been proved to be true

[C] the hot spots and the plates move slowly in opposite directions（B）

[D] the movement of hot spots proves the continents are moving apart

\68. That Africa and South America were once joined can be deduced from the fact that ________.

[A] the two continents are still moving in opposite directions

[B] they have been found to share certain geological features

[C] the African plate has been stable for 30 million years（B）

[D] over 100 hot spots are scattered all around the globe

\69. The hot spot theory may prove useful in explaining ________.

[A] the structure of the African plates

[B] the revival of dead volcanoes

[C] the mobility of the continents（D）

[D] the formation of new oceans

\70. The passage is mainly about ________.

[A] the features of volcanic activities

[B] the importance of the theory about drifting plates

[C] the significance of hot spots in geophysical studies（C）

[D] the process of the formation of volcanoes

They were, by far, the largest and most distant objects that scientists had ever detected: a strip of enormous cosmic clouds some 15 billion light-years from earth. 71) But even more important, it was the farthest that scientists had been able to look into the past, for what they were seeing were the patterns and structures that existed 15 billion years ago. That was just about the moment that the universe was born. What the researchers found was at once both amazing and expected: the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Cosmic Background Explorer satellite -- Cobe -- had discovered landmark evidence that the universe did in fact begin with the primeval explosion that has become known as the Big Bang (the theory that the universe originated in an explosion from a single mass of energy).

72) The existence of the giant clouds was virtually required for the Big Bang, first put forward in the 1920s, to maintain its reign as the dominant explanation of the cosmos. According to the theory, the universe burst into being as a submicroscopic, unimaginably dense knot of pure energy that flew outward in all directions, emitting radiation as it went, condensing into particles and then into atoms of gas. Over billions of years, the gas was compressed by gravity into galaxies, stars, plants and eventually, even humans.

Cobe is designed to see just the biggest structures, but astronomers would like to see much smaller hot spots as well, the seeds of local objects like clusters and superclusters of galaxies. They shouldn’t have long to wait. 73) Astrophysicists working with ground-based detectors at the South Pole and balloon-borne instruments are closing in on such structures, and may report their findings soon.

74) If the small hot spots look as expected, that will be a triumph for yet another scientific idea, a refinement of the Big Bang called the inflationary universe theory. Inflation says that very early on, the universe expanded in size by more than a trillion trillion trillion trillionfold in much less than a second, propelled by a sort of antigravity. 75) Odd though it sounds, cosmic inflation is a scientifically plausible consequence of some respected ideas in elementary particle physics, and many astrophysicists have been convinced for the better part of a decade that it is true.

Recently, more and more people have seen varieties of promises either from TV, newspaper or from other media. As is shown in the cartoon, even a hen has learned how to promise. We all know that hen’s duty is to lay eggs which should undoubtedly consist of most elementary part. But the hen promises what she should do!

With the development of the society and the improvement of people’s living standard, more and more attention should be paid to the improvement of quality of service. Therefore, many enterprises and departments promise to better their services so as to meet the people’s need better. They are also pleased to invite people to supervise what they have done and will do. But much to our surprise, some of them just say something that they should do. These promises are only laughed at by people.

(解释配诗, 又有议论)

In my opinion, doing more is better than promising more, because people are willing to be served really. All we should lay more emphasis on what we do and how we can virtually improve the level of service. Only in this way can we make people satisfied with what we do.

**Text 1**

It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia’s Northern Territory became the first legal authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die. The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group’s on-line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: “We posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn’t just something that happened in Australia. It’s world history.”

The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill law has left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right-to-life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia -- where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part -- other states are going to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US and Canada, where the right-to-die movement is gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling.

Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death -- probably by a deadly injection or pill -- to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally ill by two doctors. After a “cooling off” period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally Ill law means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. “I’m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I’d go, because I’ve watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,” he says.

\51. From the second paragraph we learn that ________.

[A] the objection to euthanasia is slow to come in other countries

[B] physicians and citizens share the same view on euthanasia

[C] changing technology is chiefly responsible for the hasty passage of the law（D）

[D] it takes time to realize the significance of the law’s passage

\52. When the author says that observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling, he means ________.

[A] observers are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the future of euthanasia

[B] similar bills are likely to be passed in the US, Canada and other countries

[C] observers are waiting to see the result of the game of dominoes（B）

[D] the effect-taking process of the passed bill may finally come to a stop

\53. When Lloyd Nickson dies, he will ________.

[A] face his death with calm characteristic of euthanasia

[B] experience the suffering of a lung cancer patient

[C] have an intense fear of terrible suffering（A）

[D] undergo a cooling off period of seven days

\54. The author’s attitude towards euthanasia seems to be that of ________.

[A] opposition

[B] suspicion

[C] approval（C）

[D] indifference

A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly, courteous, and helpful most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment.

For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of diversion, and brought news of the outside world.

The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin or settlement. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable impulse on the part of the settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: if you didn’t take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation.

Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the weary traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. “I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner -- amazing.” Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly. The casual friendliness of many Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial nor as artificial, but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition.

As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals, assumptions, and conventions underlies all social interrelationships. And, of course, speaking a language does not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. Visitors who fail to “translate” cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example, when an American uses the word “friend,” the cultural implications of the word may be quite different from those it has in the visitor’s language and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a bus to distinguish between courteous convention and individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a virtue that many Americans value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers.

\55. In the eyes of visitors from the outside world, ________.

[A] rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US

[B] small-minded officials deserve a serious comment

[C] Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors（D）

[D] most Americans are ready to offer help

\56. It could be inferred from the last paragraph that ________.

[A] culture exercises an influence over social interrelationship

[B] courteous convention and individual interest are interrelated

[C] various virtues manifest themselves exclusively among friends（A）

[D] social interrelationships equal the complex set of cultural conventions

\57. Families in frontier settlements used to entertain strangers ________.

[A] to improve their hard life

[B] in view of their long-distance travel

[C] to add some flavor to their own daily life（C）

[D] out of a charitable impulse

\58. The tradition of hospitality to strangers ________.

[A] tends to be superficial and artificial

[B] is generally well kept up in the United States

[C] is always understood properly（B）

[D] has something to do with the busy tourist trails

Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or mental functioning is a drug. Many people mistakenly believe the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine or an illegal chemical taken by drug addicts. They don’t realize that familiar substances such as alcohol and tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is now used by many physicians and psychologists. The phrase “substance abuse” is often used instead of “drug abuse” to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as harmfully misused as heroin and cocaine.

We live in a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances (drugs) is pervasive: an aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a cigarette for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently constructive uses of a substance become misuses? First of all, most substances taken in excess will produce negative effects such as poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a substance can also lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence is marked first by an increased tolerance, with more and more of the substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by the appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued.

Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and behavior are known as psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are commonly grouped according to whether they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants initially speed up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants slow it down. Hallucinogens have their primary effect on perception, distorting and altering it in a variety of ways including producing hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic (from the Greek word meaning “mind-manifesting”) because they seemed to radically alter one’s state of consciousness.

\59. “Substance abuse” (Line 5, Paragraph 1) is preferable to “drug abuse” in that ________.

[A] substances can alter our bodily or mental functioning if illegally used

[B] “drug abuse” is only related to a limited number of drug takers

[C] alcohol and tobacco are as fatal as heroin and cocaine（D）

[D] many substances other than heroin or cocaine can also be poisonous

\60. The word “pervasive” (Line 1, Paragraph 2) might mean ________.

[A] widespread

[B] overwhelming

[C] piercing（A）

[D] fashionable

\61. Physical dependence on certain substances results from ________.

[A] uncontrolled consumption of them over long periods of time

[B] exclusive use of them for social purposes

[C] quantitative application of them to the treatment of diseases（A）

[D] careless employment of them for unpleasant symptoms

\62. From the last paragraph we can infer that ________.

[A] stimulants function positively on the mind

[B] hallucinogens are in themselves harmful to health

[C] depressants are the worst type of psychoactive substances（B）

[D] the three types of psychoactive substances are commonly used in groups

No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral decline of a nation. “Is this what you intended to accomplish with your careers?” Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner executives last week. “You have sold your souls, but must you corrupt our nation and threaten our children as well?” At Time Warner, however, such questions are simply the latest manifestation of the soul-searching that has involved the company ever since the company was born in 1990. It’s a self-examination that has, at various times, involved issues of responsibility, creative freedom and the corporate bottom line.

At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who took over for the late Steve Ross in 1992. On the financial front, Levin is under pressure to raise the stock price and reduce the company’s mountainous debt, which will increase to $17.3 billion after two new cable deals close. He has promised to sell off some of the property and restructure the company, but investors are waiting impatiently.

The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin has consistently defended the company’s rap music on the grounds of expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under fire for releasing Ice-T’s violent rap song *Cop Killer*, Levin described rap as a lawful expression of street culture, which deserves an outlet. “The test of any democratic society,” he wrote in a *Wall Street Journal* column, “lies not in how well it can control expression but in whether it gives freedom of thought and expression the widest possible latitude, however disputable or irritating the results may sometimes be. We won’t retreat in the face of any threats.”

Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were signs that the chairman was backing off his hard-line stand, at least to some extent. During the discussion of rock singing verses at last month’s stockholders’ meeting, Levin asserted that “music is not the cause of society’s ills” and even cited his son, a teacher in the Bronx, New York, who uses rap to communicate with students. But he talked as well about the “balanced struggle” between creative freedom and social responsibility, and he announced that the company would launch a drive to develop standards for distribution and labeling of potentially objectionable music.

The 15-member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin and his corporate strategy. But insiders say several of them have shown their concerns in this matter. “Some of us have known for many, many years that the freedoms under the First Amendment are not totally unlimited,” says Luce. “I think it is perhaps the case that some people associated with the company have only recently come to realize this.”

\63. Senator Robert Dole criticized Time Warner for ________.

[A] its raising of the corporate stock price

[B] its self-examination of soul

[C] its neglect of social responsibility（C）

[D] its emphasis on creative freedom

\64. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?

[A] Luce is a spokesman of Time Warner.

[B] Gerald Levin is liable to compromise.

[C] Time Warner is united as one in the face of the debate.（D）

[D] Steve Ross is no longer alive.

\65. In face of the recent attacks on the company, the chairman ________.

[A] stuck to a strong stand to defend freedom of expression

[B] softened his tone and adopted some new policy

[C] changed his attitude and yielded to objection（B）

[D] received more support from the 15-member board

\66. The best title for this passage could be ________.

[A] A Company under Fire

[B] A Debate on Moral Decline

[C] A Lawful Outlet of Street Culture（A）

[D] A Form of Creative Freedom

**Text 5**

Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as “steering the economy to a soft landing” or “a touch on the brakes,” makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could be further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain. And there are long, variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the analogy that likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear-view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.

Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of late. Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way below the double-digit rates which many countries experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s.

It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists which *The Economist* polls each month said that America’s inflation rate would average 3.5% in 1995. In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and is expected to average only about 3% for the year as a whole. In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, inflation has been consistently lower than expected in Britain and America.

Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and the United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially America’s, have little productive slack. America’s capacity utilization, for example, hit historically high levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen below most estimates of the natural rate of unemployment -- the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past.

Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a little defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have upended the old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation.

\67. From the passage we learn that ________.

[A] there is a definite relationship between inflation and interest rates

[B] economy will always follow certain models

[C] the economic situation is better than expected（C）

[D] economists had foreseen the present economic situation

\68. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?

[A] Making monetary policies is comparable to driving a car

[B] An extremely low jobless rate will lead to inflation

[C] A high unemployment rate will result from inflation（B）

[D] Interest rates have an immediate effect on the economy

\69. The sentence “This is no flash in the pan” (Line 5, Paragraph 3) means that ________.

[A] the low inflation rate will last for some time

[B] the inflation rate will soon rise

[C] the inflation will disappear quickly（A）

[D] there is no inflation at present

\70. The passage shows that the author is ________ the present situation.

[A] critical of

[B] puzzled by

[C] disappointed at（D）

[D] amazed at

Do animals have rights? This is how the question is usually put. It sounds like a useful, ground-clearing way to start. 71) Actually, it isn’t, because it assumes that there is an agreed account of human rights, which is something the world does not have.

On one view of rights, to be sure, it necessarily follows that animals have none. 72) Some philosophers argue that rights exist only within a social contract, as part of an exchange of duties and entitlements. Therefore, animals cannot have rights. The idea of punishing a tiger that kills somebody is absurd, for exactly the same reason, so is the idea that tigers have rights. However, this is only one account, and by no means an uncontested one. It denies rights not only to animals but also to some people -- for instance, to infants, the mentally incapable and future generations. In addition, it is unclear what force a contract can have for people who never consented to it: how do you reply to somebody who says “I don’t like this contract”?

The point is this: without agreement on the rights of people, arguing about the rights of animals is fruitless. 73) It leads the discussion to extremes at the outset: it invites you to think that animals should be treated either with the consideration humans extend to other humans, or with no consideration at all. This is a false choice. Better to start with another, more fundamental, question: is the way we treat animals a moral issue at all?

Many deny it. 74) Arguing from the view that humans are different from animals in every relevant respect, extremists of this kind think that animals lie outside the area of moral choice. Any regard for the suffering of animals is seen as a mistake -- a sentimental displacement of feeling that should properly be directed to other humans.

This view, which holds that torturing a monkey is morally equivalent to chopping wood, may seem bravely “logical.” In fact it is simply shallow: the confused center is right to reject it. The most elementary form of moral reasoning -- the ethical equivalent of learning to crawl -- is to weigh others’ interests against one’s own. This in turn requires sympathy and imagination: without which there is no capacity for moral thought. To see an animal in pain is enough, for most, to engage sympathy. 75) When that happens, it is not a mistake: it is mankind’s instinct for moral reasoning in action, an instinct that should be encouraged rather than laughed at.

例文一

We meet smokers everywhere: in the streets, on college campuses and in shops. There are 5.8 billion people in the world, and the smokers are about 1.1 billion, which makes up 20 percent of the world’s total population.

Smoking is very harmful. I think there are two main aspects to the damage. First, smoking consumes a great deal of money. As is shown in the pictorial graph, smoking wastes 200 billion dollars each year in the world. Second, smoking does harm to the health of smokers, and it is the main cause of lung cancer. About 3 million people die because of the relevant diseases derived from smoking every year.

Because more and more people are aware of the great harm of smoking to humans, the amount of tobacco consumption is on the decrease. From the following figures we can clearly see the tendency. The total amount of world tobacco production added up to 14.364 billion pounds in 1994, but it dropped to 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. At the same time, many countries call on people to give up smoking. So it is certain that the number of smokers is to decrease.

例文二

About Tobacco Consumption

From the above set of pictures, we can see that there were a total of 14.364 billion pounds of tobacco produced in 1994 and 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. Because the amount of tobacco production is falling yearly, it can be predicted that the tendency of tobacco consumption would also be falling yearly. There are many reasons. Firstly, smoking wastes money. Every year there are two hundred billion dollars “burnt” in the cigarette “fire.” Secondly, smoking would hardly do people any good and it can even cause cancer. Every year there are three million people “buried” in the cigarette “tomb”.

Although tobacco consumption is falling, there are too many people who smoke. The population in the world is 5.8 billion, but about twenty percent of the population, that is to say 1.1 billion people, smoke. So the situation is serious and the movement against smoking is still a difficult task.

**Text 1**

Tight-lipped elders used to say, “It’s not what you want in this world, but what you get.”

Psychology teaches that you do get what you want if you know what you want and want the right things.

You can make a mental blueprint of a desire as you would make a blueprint of a house, and each of us is continually making these blueprints in the general routine of everyday living. If we intend to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, decide which food to cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type of meal to be served.

Likewise, if you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and write a brief account of yourself. In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself, for when you know exactly what you have to offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.

This account of yourself is actually a sketch of your working life and should include education, experience and references. Such an account is valuable. It can be referred to in filling out standard application blanks and is extremely helpful in personal interviews. While talking to you, your could-be employer is deciding whether your education, your experience, and other qualifications, will pay him to employ you and your “wares” and abilities must be displayed in an orderly and reasonably connected manner.

When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something tangible to sell. Then you are ready to hunt for a job. Get all the possible information about your could-be job. Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job and the firm. Keep your eyes and ears open, and use your own judgment. Spend a certain amount of time each day seeking the employment you wish for, and keep in mind: Securing a job is your job now.

\51. What do the elders mean when they say, “It’s not what you want in this world, but what you get.”?

[A] You’ll certainly get what you want.

[B] It’s no use dreaming.

[C] You should be dissatisfied with what you have.（B）

[D] It’s essential to set a goal for yourself.

\52. A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner is used in this passage as ________.

[A] an illustration of how to write an application for a job

[B] an indication of how to secure a good job

[C] a guideline for job description（A）

[D] a principle for job evaluation

\53. According to the passage, one must write an account of himself before starting to find a job because ________.

[A] that is the first step to please the employer

[B] that is the requirement of the employer

[C] it enables him to know when to sell his services（D）

[D] it forces him to become clearly aware of himself

\54. When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something ________.

[A] definite to offer

[B] imaginary to provide

[C] practical to supply（A）

[D] desirable to present

With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers in Asia and America can now watch the Corporation’s news coverage, as well as listen to it.

And of course in Britain listeners and viewers can tune in to two BBC television channels, five BBC national radio services and dozens of local radio stations. They are brought sport, comedy, drama, music, news and current affairs, education, religion, parliamentary coverage, children’s programmes and films for an annual license fee of ￡83 per household.

It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years -- yet the BBC’s future is now in doubt. The Corporation will survive as a publicly-funded broadcasting organization, at least for the time being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the subject of a nation-wide debate in Britain.

The debate was launched by the Government, which invited anyone with an opinion of the BBC -- including ordinary listeners and viewers -- to say what was good or bad about the Corporation, and even whether they thought it was worth keeping. The reason for its inquiry is that the BBC’s royal charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the organization as it is, or to make changes.

Defenders of the Corporation -- of whom there are many -- are fond of quoting the American slogan “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The BBC “ain’t broke,” they say, by which they mean it is not broken (as distinct from the word ‘broke’, meaning having no money), so why bother to change it?

Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world around it is changing. The commercial TV channels – ITV and Channel 4 -- were required by the Thatcher Government’s Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each other for advertisers, and cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival of new satellite channels -- funded partly by advertising and partly by viewers’ subscriptions -- which will bring about the biggest changes in the long term.

\55. The world famous BBC now faces ________.

[A] the problem of new coverage

[B] an uncertain prospect

[C] inquiries by the general public（B）

[D] shrinkage of audience

\56. In the passage, which of the following about the BBC is NOT mentioned as the key issue?

[A] Extension of its TV service to Far East.

[B] Programmes as the subject of a nation-wide debate.

[C] Potentials for further international cooperations.（C）

[D] Its existence as a broadcasting organization.

\57. The BBC’s “royal charter” (Line 4, Paragraph 4) stands for ________.

[A] the financial support from the royal family

[B] the privileges granted by the Queen

[C] a contract with the Queen（C）

[D] a unique relationship with the royal family

\58. The foremost reason why the BBC has to readjust itself is no other than ________.

[A] the emergence of commercial TV channels

[B] the enforcement of Broadcasting Act by the government

[C] the urgent necessity to reduce costs and jobs（D）

[D] the challenge of new satellite channels

**Text 3**

In the last half of the nineteenth century “capital” and “labour” were enlarging and perfecting their rival organizations on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by a limited liability company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. The change met the technical requirements of the new age by engaging a large professional element and prevented the decline in efficiency that so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms in the second and third generation after the energetic founders. It was moreover a step away from individual initiative, towards collectivism and municipal and state-owned business. The railway companies, though still private business managed for the benefit of shareholders, were very unlike old family business. At the same time the great municipalities went into business to supply lighting, trams and other services to the taxpayers.

The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business had important consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management of business. All through the nineteenth century, America, Africa, India, Australia and parts of Europe were being developed by British capital, and British shareholders were thus enriched by the world’s movement towards industrialization. Towns like Bournemouth and Eastbourne sprang up to house large “comfortable” classes who had retired on their incomes, and who had no relation to the rest of the community except that of drawing dividends and occasionally attending a shareholders’ meeting to dictate their orders to the management. On the other hand “shareholding” meant leisure and freedom which was used by many of the later Victorians for the highest purpose of a great civilization.

The “shareholders” as such had no knowledge of the lives, thoughts or needs of the workmen employed by the company in which he held shares, and his influence on the relations of capital and labour was not good. The paid manager acting for the company was in more direct relation with the men and their demands, but even he had seldom that familiar personal knowledge of the workmen which the employer had often had under the more patriarchal system of the old family business now passing away. Indeed the mere size of operations and the numbers of workmen involved rendered such personal relations impossible. Fortunately, however, the increasing power and organization of the trade unions, at least in all skilled trades, enabled the workmen to meet on equal terms the managers of the companies who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike and lockout taught the two parties to respect each other’s strength and understand the value of fair negotiation.

 

\59. It’s true of the old family firms that ________.

[A] they were spoiled by the younger generations

[B] they failed for lack of individual initiative

[C] they lacked efficiency compared with modern companies（C）

[D] they could supply adequate services to the taxpayers

\60. The growth of limited liability companies resulted in ________.

[A] the separation of capital from management

[B] the ownership of capital by managers

[C] the emergence of capital and labour as two classes（A）

[D] the participation of shareholders in municipal business

\61. According to the passage, all of the following are true EXCEPT that ________.

[A] the shareholders were unaware of the needs of the workers

[B] the old firm owners had a better understanding of their workers

[C] the limited liability companies were too large to run smoothly（C）

[D] the trade unions seemed to play a positive role

\62. The author is most critical of ________.

[A] family film owners

[B] landowners

[C] managers（D）

[D] shareholders

**Text 4**

What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early America -- breakthroughs such as the telegraph, the steamboat and the weaving machine?

Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country’s excellent elementary schools: a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums to inventors; and above all the American genius for nonverbal, “spatial” thinking about things technological.

Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools our early mechanics, especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, were generally literate and at home in arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.

Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and inventiveness to this educational advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 1853 reported, “With a mind prepared by thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly into the skilled workman.”

A further stimulus to invention came from the “premium” system, which preceded our patent system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, originated abroad, offered inventors medals, cash prizes and other incentives.

In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were awarded at country fairs and at the industrial fairs in major cities. Americans flocked to these fairs to admire the new machines and thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance.

Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the American worker took readily to that special kind of nonverbal thinking required in mechanical technology. As Eugene Ferguson has pointed out, “A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be reduced to unambiguous verbal descriptions: they are dealt with in his mind by a visual, nonverbal process... The designer and the inventor... are able to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices that as yet do not exist.”

This nonverbal “spatial” thinking can be just as creative as painting and writing. Robert Fulton once wrote, “The mechanic should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels, etc., like a poet among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, in which a new arrangement transmits a new idea.”

When all these shaping forces -- schools, open attitudes, the premium system, a genius for spatial thinking -- interacted with one another on the rich U.S. mainland, they produced that American characteristic, emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But in earlier times it meant a friendly but competitive striving for fame and excellence.

\63. According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions in early America was in a large part due to ________.

[A] elementary schools

[B] enthusiastic workers

[C] the attractive premium system（D）

[D] a special way of thinking

\64. It is implied that adaptiveness and inventiveness of the early American mechanics ________.

[A] benefited a lot from their mathematical knowledge

[B] shed light on disciplined school management

[C] was brought about by privileged home training（A）

[D] owed a lot to the technological development

\65. A technologist can be compared to an artist because ________.

[A] they are both winners of awards

[B] they are both experts in spatial thinking

[C] they both abandon verbal description（B）

[D] they both use various instruments

\66. The best title for this passage might be ________.

[A] Inventive Mind

[B] Effective Schooling

[B] Ways of Thinking（A）

[D] Outpouring of Inventions

Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in the publisher’s pipelines. A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused and often unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific theories for the origin and evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and biology have provided a consistent, unified, and constantly improving account of what happened. “Scientific” creationism, which is being pushed by some for “equal time” in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of evolution are given, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all scientists and the majority of non-fundamentalist religious leaders have come to regard “scientific” creationism as bad science and bad religion.

The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. In the last three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He describes their programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the extent of their deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is religious, one might have expected more Christian behavior.

Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness of his arguments. The non-specialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the creationists will be extremely clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen Jay Gould says: “This book stands for reason itself.” And so it does -- and all would be well were reason the only judge in the creationism/evolution debate.

\67. “Creationism” in the passage refers to ________.

[A] evolution in its true sense as to the origin of the universe

[B] a notion of the creation of religion

[C] the scientific explanation of the earth formation（D）

[D] the deceptive theory about the origin of the universe

\68. Kitcher’s book is intended to ________.

[A] recommend the views of the evolutionists

[B] expose the true features of creationists

[C] curse bitterly at this opponents（B）

[D] launch a surprise attack on creationists

\69. From the passage we can infer that ________.

[A] reasoning has played a decisive role in the debate

[B] creationists do not base their argument on reasoning

[C] evolutionary theory is too difficult for non-specialists（B）

[D] creationism is supported by scientific findings

\70. This passage appears to be a digest of ________.

[A] a book review

[B] a scientific paper

[C] a magazine feature（A）

[D] a newspaper editorial

**Section IV English-Chinese Translation**

**Directions:**

Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written clearly on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (15 points)

The differences in relative growth of various areas of scientific research have several causes. 71) Some of these causes are completely reasonable results of social needs. Others are reasonable consequences of particular advances in science being to some extent self-accelerating. Some, however, are less reasonable processes of different growth in which preconception of the form scientific theory ought to take, by persons in authority, act to alter the growth pattern of different areas. This is a new problem probably not yet unavoidable; but it is a frightening trend. 72) This trend began during the Second World War, when several governments came to the conclusion that the specific demands that a government wants to make of its scientific establishment cannot generally be foreseen in detail. It can be predicted, however, that from time to time, questions will arise which will require specific scientific answers. It is therefore generally valuable to treat the scientific establishment as a resource or machine to be kept in functional order. 73) This seems mostly effectively done by supporting a certain amount of research not related to immediate goals but of possible consequence in the future.

This kind of support, like all government support, requires decisions about the appropriate recipients of funds. Decisions based on utility as opposed to lack of utility are straightforward. But a decision among projects none of which has immediate utility is more difficult. The goal of the supporting agencies is the praisable one of supporting “good” as opposed to “bad” science, but a valid determination is difficult to make. Generally, the idea of good science tends to become confused with the capacity of the field in question to generate an elegant theory. 74) However, the world is so made that elegant systems are in principle unable to deal with some of the world’s more fascinating and delightful aspects. 75) New forms of thought as well as new subjects for thought must arise in the future as they have in the past, giving rise to new standards of elegance.

GOOD HEALTH

Wherever you are and whatever you do, staying healthy is always important. With the improvement of our living standards, people are attaching more and more importance to their health. We students can’t keep the high study efficiency without good health. The same thing is true with workers, scientists and doctors.

In my opinion, good diet and exercises are two major ways to keep healthy. The food we eat every day must be rational and should include meat, vegetables, eggs, and fruit. It is important to drink water every day and not to get addicted to drinking coffee or some other soft drinks. Exercising every day is also essential for us to stay healthy. We can ride bicycles, play tennis or swim. Of course we don’t need to exhaust ourselves. We should plan our physical exercises according to our actual condition. An hour a day is enough.

As a university student, I have much free time to do exercises. I usually play badminton and tennis. But sometimes I am lazy and do not exercise for all kinds of excuses, such as cold weather and exams. I must correct it. I am also careful with my diet. In a way, keeping healthy is not very hard, if you just take it seriously.

Sleep is divided into periods of so-called REM sleep, characterized by rapid eye movements and dreaming, and longer periods of non-REM sleep.  kind of sleep is at all well-understood, but REM sleep is  to serve some restorative function of the brain. The purpose of non-REM sleep is even more . The new experiments, such as those  for the first time at a recent meeting of the Society for Sleep Research in Minneapolis, suggest fascinating explanations  of non-REM sleep.

For example, it has long been known that total sleep  is 100 percent fatal to rats, yet,  examination of the dead bodies, the animals look completely normal.

**Text 1**

Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labour, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more.

And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I know that the article does what is claimed for it, and that it represents good value.

Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can think of.

There is one point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs. He was drawing excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to persuade.

If its message were confined merely to information -- and that in itself would be difficult if not impossible to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly persuasive -- advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But perhaps that is what the well-known television personality wants.

\51. By the first sentence of the passage the author means that ________.

[A] he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising

[B] everybody knows well that advertising is money consuming

[C] advertising costs money like everything else（D）

[D] it is worthwhile to spend money on advertising

\52. In the passage, which of the following is NOT included in the advantages of advertising?

[A] Securing greater fame.

[B] Providing more jobs.

[C] Enhancing living standards.（A）

[D] Reducing newspaper cost.

\53. The author deems that the well-known TV personality is ________.

[A] very precise in passing his judgment on advertising

[B] interested in nothing but the buyers’ attention

[C] correct in telling the difference between persuasion and information（D）

[D] obviously partial in his views on advertising

\54. In the author’s opinion, ________.

[A] advertising can seldom bring material benefit to man by providing information

[B] advertising informs people of new ideas rather than wins them over

[C] there is nothing wrong with advertising in persuading the buyer（C）

[D] the buyer is not interested in getting information from an advertisement

**Text 2**

There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People have generally viewed personal growth as an external result or product that can easily be identified and measured. The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner who learns a new language -- all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts.

By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since by definition it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as they encounter new experiences and unexpected obstacles. In this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept.

In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may “fail” at first. How we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is essential to our ability to grow. Do we perceive ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we’re shy and indecisive? Then our sense of timidity can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step until we know the ground is safe. Do we think we’re slow to adapt to change or that we’re not smart enough to cope with a new challenge? Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all.

These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to change and grow. If we do not confront and overcome these internal fears and doubts, if we protect ourselves too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped inside a shell of our own making.

\55. A person is generally believed to achieve personal growth when ________.

[A] he has given up his smoking habit

[B] he has made great efforts in his work

[C] he is keen on leaning anything new（A）

[D] he has tried to determine where he is on his journey

\56. In the author’s eyes, one who views personal growth as a process would ________.

[A] succeed in climbing up the social ladder

[B] judge his ability to grow from his own achievements

[C] face difficulties and take up challenges（C）

[D] aim high and reach his goal each time

 

\57. When the author says “a new way of being” (Line 2~3, Para. 3) he is referring to ________.

[A] a new approach to experiencing the world

[B] a new way of taking risks

[C] a new method of perceiving ourselves（A）

[D] a new system of adaptation to change

\58. For personal growth, the author advocates all of the following EXCEPT ________.

[A] curiosity about more chances

[B] promptness in self-adaptation

[C] open-mindedness to new experiences（D）

[D] avoidance of internal fears and doubts

**Text 3**

In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become complicated. Many of life’s problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people today.

In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War II. As families move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be consciously learned.

Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one piece of information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated, time-consuming and sometimes even overwhelming.

Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information. Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared worldwide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making more information available to more people.

In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance. Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems, the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed. “Knowledge is power” may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most critical requirement of all people.

\59. The word “it” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably refers to ________.

[A] the lack of stable communities

[B] the breakdown of informal information channels

[C] the increased mobility of families（B）

[D] the growing number of people moving from place to place

\60. The main problem people may encounter today arises from the fact that ________.

[A] they have to learn new things consciously

[B] they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy information

[C] they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily（C）

[D] they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended family

\61. From the passage we can infer that ________.

[A] electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting messages

[B] it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an information era

[C] people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences（A）

[D] events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites

\62. We can learn from the last paragraph that ________.

[A] it is necessary to obtain as much knowledge as possible

[B] people should make the best use of the information accessible

[C] we should realize the importance of accumulating information（D）

[D] it is of vital importance to acquire needed information efficiently

**Text 4**

Personality is to a large extent inherent -- A-type parents usually bring about A-type offspring. But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if competition is important to the parents, it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.

One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the “win at all costs” moral standard and measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children compete against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer system, in which competitive A-types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the first marathon runner, dropped dead seconds after saying: “Rejoice, we conquer!”

By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate emphasis on examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful.

Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A youngsters change into B’s. The world needs A types, and schools have an important duty to try to fit a child’s personality to his possible future employment. It is top management.

If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, more time might be spent teaching children surer values. Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially medicine, could be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as sensitivity and sympathy. It is surely a mistake to choose our doctors exclusively from A-type stock. B’s are important and should be encouraged.

\63. According to the passage, A-type individuals are usually ________.

[A] impatient

[B] considerate

[C] aggressive（C）

[D] agreeable

\64. The author is strongly opposed to the practice of examinations at schools because ________.

[A] the pressure is too great on the students

[B] some students are bound to fail

[C] failure rates are too high（B）

[D] the results of exanimations are doubtful

\65. The selection of medical professionals is currently based on ________.

[A] candidates’ sensitivity

[B] academic achievements

[C] competitive spirit（B）

[D] surer values

\66. From the passage we can draw the conclusion that ________.

[A] the personality of a child is well established at birth

[B] family influence dominates the shaping of one’s characteristics

[C] the development of one’s personality is due to multiple factors（C）

[D] B-type characteristics can find no place in competitive society

**Text 5**

That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an obvious but nevertheless remarkable activity called remembering. Learning could not occur without the function popularly named memory. Constant practice has such an effect on memory as to lead to skillful performance on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and understanding these words. So-called intelligent behaviour demands memory, remembering being a primary requirement for reasoning. The ability to solve any problem or even to recognize that a problem exists depends on memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street is based on remembering many earlier experiences.

Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task or for any learned material. Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and the adaptive consequences may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting can be seen to be adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be interpreted to have survived through a process of natural selection in animals. Indeed, when one’s memory of an emotionally painful experience lead to serious anxiety, forgetting may produce relief. Nevertheless, an evolutionary interpretation might make it difficult to understand how the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived natural selection.

In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its possible aspects, it is helpful to consider what would happen if memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids orientation in time, since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing clues for inferring duration. Without forgetting, adaptive ability would suffer, for example, learned behaviour that might have been correct a decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of people who (by ordinary standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were full of confusion. Thus forgetting seems to serve that survival of the individual and the species.

Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited capacity that provides adaptive flexibility specifically through forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are made between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). Indeed, there is evidence that the rate at which individuals forget is directly related to how much they have learned. Such data offer gross support of contemporary models of memory that assume an input-output balance.

 

\67. From the evolutionary point of view, ________.

[A] forgetting for lack of practice tends to be obviously inadaptive

[B] if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be very adaptive

[C] the gradual process of forgetting is an indication of an individual’s adaptability（D）

[D] sudden forgetting may bring about adaptive consequences

\68. According to the passage, if a person never forgot, ________.

[A] he would survive best

[B] he would have a lot of trouble

[C] his ability to learn would be enhanced（B）

[D] the evolution of memory would stop

\69. From the last paragraph we know that ________.

[A] forgetfulness is a response to learning

[B] the memory storage system is an exactly balanced input-output system

[C] memory is a compensation for forgetting（A）

[D] the capacity of a memory storage system is limited because forgetting occurs

\70. In this article, the author tries to interpret the function of ________.

[A] remembering

[B] forgetting

[C] adapting（B）

[D] experiencing

**Section IV English-Chinese Translation**

**Directions:**

Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written neatly on **ANSWER SHEET 2**. (15 points)

The standardized educational or psychological tests that are widely used to aid in selecting, classifying, assigning, or promoting students, employees, and military personnel have been the target of recent attacks in books, magazines, the daily press, and even in Congress. 71) The target is wrong, for in attacking the tests, critics divert attention from the fault that lies with ill-informed or incompetent users. The tests themselves are merely tools, with characteristics that can be measured with reasonable precision under specified conditions. Whether the results will be valuable, meaningless, or even misleading depends partly upon the tool itself but largely upon the user.

All informed predictions of future performance are based upon some knowledge of relevant past performance: school grades, research productivity, sales records, or whatever is appropriate. 72) How well the predictions will be validated by later performance depends upon the amount, reliability, and appropriateness of the information used and on the skill and wisdom with which it is interpreted. Anyone who keeps careful score knows that the information available is always incomplete and that the predictions are always subject to error.

Standardized tests should be considered in this context. They provide a quick, objective method of getting some kinds of information about what a person learned, the skills he has developed, or the kind of person he is. The information so obtained has, qualitatively, the same advantages and shortcomings as other kinds of information. 73) Whether to use tests, other kinds of information, or both in a particular situation depends, therefore, upon the evidence from experience concerning comparative validity and upon such factors as cost and availability.

74) In general, the tests work most effectively when the qualities to be measured can be most precisely defined and least effectively when what is to be measured or predicted cannot be well defined. Properly used, they provide a rapid means of getting comparable information about many people. Sometimes they identify students whose high potential has not been previously recognized, but there are many things they do not do. 75) For example, they do not compensate for gross social inequality, and thus do not tell how able an underprivileged youngster might have been had he grown up under more favorable circumstances.

**Text 1**

The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it.

An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the American economic system.

The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual.

\51. In Line 8, Paragraph 1, “the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes” means ________.

[A] Americans are never satisfied with their incomes

[B] Americans tend to overstate their incomes

[C] Americans want to have their incomes increased（D）

[D] Americans want to increase the purchasing power of their incomes

\52. The first two sentences in the second paragraph tell us that ________.

[A] producers can satisfy the consumers by mechanized production

[B] consumers can express their demands through producers

[C] producers decide the prices of products（D）

[D] supply and demand regulate prices

\53. According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is characterized by ________.

[A] private property and rights concerned

[B] manpower and natural resources control

[C] ownership of productive resources（A）

[D] free contracts and prices

\54. The passage is mainly about ________.

[A] how American goods are produced

[B] how American consumers buy their goods

[C] how American economic system works（C）

[D] how American businessmen make their profits

**Text 2**

One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country, and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the “cashless society” is not on the horizon -- it’s already here.

While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold and how fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the same time these computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the most efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also identify preferred customers for promotional campaigns. Computers are relied on by manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which products to emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.

Numerous other commercial enterprises, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to consumers through the use of computers.

\55. According to the passage, the credit card enables its owner to ________.

[A] withdraw as much money from the bank as he wishes

[B] obtain more convenient services than other people do

[C] enjoy greater trust from the storekeeper（B）

[D] cash money wherever he wishes to

\56. From the last sentence of the first paragraph we learn that ________.

[A] in the future all the Americans will use credit cards

[B] credit cards are mainly used in the United States today

[C] nowadays many Americans do not pay in cash（C）

[D] it is now more convenient to use credit cards than before

\57. The phrase “ring up sales” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means “________”.

[A] make an order of goods

[B] record sales on a cash register

[C] call the sales manager（B）

[D] keep track of the goods in stock

\58. What is this passage mainly about?

[A] Approaches to the commercial use of computers.

[B] Conveniences brought about by computers in business.

[C] Significance of automation in commercial enterprises.（B）

[D] Advantages of credit cards in business.

**Text 3**

Exceptional children are different in some significant way from others of the same age. For these children to develop to their full adult potential, their education must be adapted to those differences.

Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find ourselves describing their environment as well. While the leading actor on the stage captures our attention, we are aware of the importance of the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both the family and the society in which exceptional children live are often the key to their growth and development. And it is in the public schools that we find the full expression of society’s understanding -- the knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the next generation.

Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that mirror we can see the strengths, the weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and the central values of the culture itself. The great interest in exceptional children shown in public education over the past three decades indicates the strong feeling in our society that all citizens, whatever their special conditions, deserve the opportunity to fully develop their capabilities.

“All men are created equal.” We’ve heard it many times, but it still has important meaning for education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used by this country’s founders to denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to mean equality of opportunity. That concept implies educational opportunity for all children -- the right of each child to receive help in learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that capacity be small or great. Recent court decisions have confirmed the right of all children -- disabled or not -- to an appropriate education, and have ordered that public schools take the necessary steps to provide that education. In response, schools are modifying their programs, adapting instruction to children who are exceptional, to those who cannot profit substantially from regular programs.

\59. In Paragraph 2, the author cites the example of the leading actor on the stage to show that ________.

[A] the growth of exceptional children has much to do with their family and the society

[B] exceptional children are more influenced by their families than normal children are

[C] exceptional children are the key interest of the family and society（A）

[D] the needs of the society weigh much heavier than the needs of the exceptional children

\60. The reason that the exceptional children receive so much concern in education is that ________.

[A] they are expected to be leaders of the society

[B] they might become a burden of the society

[C] they should fully develop their potential（C）

[D] disabled children deserve special consideration

\61. This passage mainly deals with ________.

[A] the differences of children in their learning capabilities

[B] the definition of exceptional children in modern society

[C] the special educational programs for exceptional children（D）

[D] the necessity of adapting education to exceptional children

\62. From this passage we learn that the educational concern for exceptional children ________.

[A] is now enjoying legal support

[B] disagrees with the tradition of the country

“I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we’ll know in vast detail how cancer cells arise,” says microbiologist Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. “But,” he cautions, “some people have the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure will rapidly follow. Consider Pasteur, he discovered the causes of many kinds of infections, but it was fifty or sixty years before cures were available.”

This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from cancer will survive at least five years. In the year 2000, the National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 75 percent. For some skin cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90 percent. But other survival statistics are still discouraging -- 13 percent for lung cancer, and 2 percent for cancer of the pancreas (胰腺).

With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how cancer works is not easy. The researchers made great progress in the early 1970s, when they discovered that oncogenes, which are cancer-causing genes (基因), are inactive in normal cells. Anything from cosmic rays to radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains unknown. If several oncogenes are driven into action, the cell, unable to turn them off, becomes cancerous.

The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the likelihood that many cancers are initiated at the level of genes suggests that we will never prevent all cancers. “Changes are a normal part of the evolutionary process,” says oncologist William Hayward. Environmental factors can never be totally eliminated; as Hayward points out, “We can’t prepare a medicine against cosmic rays.”

The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter.

“First, we need to understand how the normal cell controls itself. Second, we have to determine whether there are a limited number of genes in cells which are always responsible for at least part of the trouble. If we can understand how cancer works, we can counteract its action.”

\63. The example of Pasteur in the passage is used to ________.

[A] predict that the secret of cancer will be disclosed in a decade

[B] indicate that the prospects for curing cancer are bright

[C] prove that cancer will be cured in fifty to sixty years（D）

[D] warn that there is still a long way to go before cancer can be conquered

\64. The author implies that by the year 2000, ________.

[A] there will be a drastic rise in the five-year survival rate of skin-cancer patients

[B] 90 percent of the skin-cancer patients today will still be living

[C] the survival statistics will be fairly even among patients with various cancers（D）

[D] there won’ t be a drastic increase of survival rate of all cancer patients

[A] that are always in operation in a healthy person

[B] which remain unharmful so long as they are not activated

[C] that can be driven out of normal cells（B）

Discoveries in science and technology are thought by “untaught minds” to come in blinding flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have it, look at the mold (霉) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his discovery. Inventions and innovations almost always come out of laborious trial and error. Innovation is like soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently than they score.

The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal -- and so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between innovators and others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on theirs, and they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise. What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid possibilities.

“Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there’s no particular virtue in doing things the way they have always been done,” wrote Rudolph Flesch, a language authority. This accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and suitcases on wheels that make life more convenient: “How come nobody thought of that before?”

The creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as it appears. Innovators will not accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route. The innovator will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the long run and are bound to be more interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends.

Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.

\67. What does the author probably mean by “untaught mind” in the first paragraph?

[A] A person ignorant of the hard work involved in experimentation.

[B] A citizen of a society that restricts personal creativity.

[C] A person who has had no education.（A）

[D] An individual who often comes up with new ideas by accident.

\68. According to the author, what distinguishes innovators from non-innovators?

[A] The variety of ideas they have.

[B] The intelligence they possess.

[C] The way they deal with problems.（C）

[D] The way they present their findings.

\69. The author quotes Rudolph Flesch in Paragraph 3 because ________.

[A] Rudolph Flesch is the best-known expert in the study of human creativity

[B] the quotation strengthens the assertion that creative individuals look for new ways of doing things

[C] the reader is familiar with Rudolph Flesch’s point of view（B）

[D] the quotation adds a new idea to the information previously presented

\70. The phrase “march to a different drummer” (the last line of the passage) suggests that highly creative individuals are ________.

[A] diligent in pursuing their goals

[B] reluctant to follow common ways of doing things

[C] devoted to the progress of society（B）

[D] concerned about the advance of society

According to the new school of scientists, technology is an overlooked force in expanding the horizons of scientific knowledge. (71) Science moves forward, they say, not so much through the insights of great men of genius as because of more ordinary things like improved techniques and tools. (72) “In short,” a leader of the new school contends, “the scientific revolution, as we call it, was largely the improvement and invention and use of a series of instruments that expanded the reach of science in innumerable directions.”

(73) Over the years, tools and technology themselves as a source of fundamental innovation have largely been ignored by historians and philosophers of science. The modern school that hails technology argues that such masters as Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and inventors such as Edison attached great importance to, and derived great benefit from, craft information and technological devices of different kinds that were usable in scientific experiments.

The centerpiece of the argument of a technology-yes, genius-no advocate was an analysis of Galileo’s role at the start of the scientific revolution. The wisdom of the day was derived from Ptolemy, an astronomer of the second century, whose elaborate system of the sky put Earth at the center of all heavenly motions. (74) Galileo’s greatest glory was that in 1609 he was the first person to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens to prove that the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the Earth. But the real hero of the story, according to the new school of scientists, was the long evolution in the improvement of machinery for making eye-glasses.

Federal policy is necessarily involved in the technology vs. genius dispute. (75) Whether the Government’s should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of technology or vice versa (反之) often depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving force.

**Text 1**

Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the drastic experiment of Frederick II in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.

All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.

Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.

Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months he can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to fifty words. At three he knows about 1,000 words which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.

Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man’s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern “toy-bear.” And even more incredible is the young brain’s ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.

But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child’s babbling (咿呀学语), grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child’s non-verbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language.

\31. The purpose of Frederick II’s experiment was ________.

[A] to prove that children are born with the ability to speak

[B] to discover what language a child would speak without hearing any human speech

[C] to find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching a child to speak（B）

[D] to prove that a child could be damaged without learning a language

\32. The reason some children are backward in speaking is most probably that ________.

[A] they are incapable of learning language rapidly

[B] they are exposed to too much language at once

[C] their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak（C）

[D] their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them

\33. What is exceptionally remarkable about a child is that ________.

[A] he is born with the capacity to speak

[B] he has a brain more complex than an animal’s

[C] he can produce his own sentences（C）

[D] he owes his speech ability to good nursing

 

\34. Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage?

[A] The faculty of speech is inborn in man.

[B] Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in language learning.

[C] The child’s brain is highly selective.（B）

[D] Most children learn their language in definite stages.

\35. If a child starts to speak later than others, he will in future ________.

[A] have a high IQ

[B] be less intelligent

[C] be insensitive to verbal signals（D）

[D] not necessarily be backward

**Text 2**

In general, our society is becoming one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic (官僚主义的) management in which man becomes a small, well-oiled cog in the machinery. The oiling is done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped music, and by psychologists and “human-relations” experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become powerless, that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and that he is bored with it. In fact, the blue- and the white-collar workers have become economic puppets who dance to the tune of automated machines and bureaucratic management.

The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might find themselves out of a job; they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest in life. They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental realities of human existence as emotionally and intellectually independent and productive human beings.

Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their lives are no less empty than those of their subordinates. They are even more insecure in some respects. They are in a highly competitive race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary but even more a matter of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are tested for intelligence as well as for the tight mixture of submissiveness and independence. From that moment on they are tested again and again -- by the psychologists, for whom testing is a big business, and by their superiors, who judge their behavior, sociability, capacity to get along, etc. This constant need to prove that one is as good as or better than one’s fellow-competitor creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes of unhappiness and illness.

Am I suggesting that we should return to the preindustrial mode of production or to nineteenth-century “free enterprise” capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never solved by returning to a stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming our social system from a bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and consumption are ends in themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full development of his potentialities -- those of love and of reason -- are the aims of all social arrangements. Production and consumption should serve only as means to this end, and should be prevented from ruling man.

\36. By “a well-oiled cog in the machinery” the author intends to render the idea that man is ________.

[A] a necessary part of the society though each individual’s function is negligible

[B] working in complete harmony with the rest of the society

[C] an unimportant part in comparison with the rest of the society, though functioning smoothly（C）

[D] a humble component of the society, especially when working smoothly

\37. The real cause of the anxiety of the workers and employees is that ________.

[A] they are likely to lose their jobs

[B] they have no genuine satisfaction or interest in life

[C] they are faced with the fundamental realities of human existence（D）

[D] they are deprived of their individuality and independence

\38. From the passage we can infer that real happiness of life belongs to those ________.

[A] who are at the bottom of the society

[B] who are higher up in their social status

[C] who prove better than their fellow-competitors（D）

[D] who could keep far away from this competitive world

\39. To solve the present social problems the author suggests that we should ________.

[A] resort to the production mode of our ancestors

[B] offer higher wages to the workers and employees

[C] enable man to fully develop his potentialities（C）

[D] take the fundamental realities for granted

\40. The author’s attitude towards industrialism might best be summarized as one of ________.

[A] approval

[B] dissatisfaction

[C] suspicion（B）

[D] tolerance

**Text 3**

When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him: he can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.

A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by which the inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention to the public after that period terminates.

Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a patent extended to alter this normal process of events.

The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent’s normal life there was no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention.

Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the library attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that are free for anyone to use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a search through live patents that the one sure way of avoiding violation of any other inventor’s right is to plagiarize a dead patent. Likewise, because publication of an idea in any other form permanently invalidates further patents on that idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern technological advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.

Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most “new” ideas are, in fact, as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. The basic patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original ideas behind television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the rear.

\41. The passage is mainly about ________.

[A] an approach to patents

[B] the application for patents

[C] the use of patents（D）

[D] the access to patents

\42. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

[A] When a patent becomes out of effect, it can be re-patented or extended if necessary.

[B] It is necessary for an inventor to apply for a patent before he makes his invention public.

[C] A patent holder must publicize the details of his invention when its legal period is over.（C）

[D] One can get all the details of a patented invention from a library attached to the patent office.

\43. George Valensi’s patent lasted until 1971 because ________.

[A] nobody would offer any reward for his patent prior to that time

[B] his patent could not be put to use for an unusually long time

[C] there were not enough TV stations to provide colour programmes（B）

[D] the colour TV receiver was not available until that time

[A] steal and use

[B] give reward to

[C] make public（A）

[D] take and change

\45. From the passage we learn that ________.

[A] an invention will not benefit the inventor unless it is reduced to commercial practice

[B] products are actually inventions which were made a long time ago

[C] it is much cheaper to buy an old patent than a new one（A）

Although interior design has existed since the beginning of architecture, its development into a specialized field is really quite recent. Interior designers have become important partly because of the many functions that might be  in a single large building.

The importance of interior design becomes  when we realize how much time we  surrounded by four walls. Whenever we need to be indoors, we want our surroundings to be  attractive and comfortable as possible. We also expect  place to be appropriate to its use. You would be  if the inside of your bedroom were suddenly changed to look  the inside of a restaurant. And you wouldn’t feel  in a business office that has the appearance of a school.

It soon becomes clear that the interior designer’s most important basic  is the function of the particular . For example, a theater with poor sight lines, poor sound-shaping qualities, and  few entries and exits will not work for  purpose, no matter how beautifully it might be . Nevertheless, for any kind of space, the designer has to make many of the same kind of . He or she must coordinate the shapes, lighting and decoration of everything from ceiling to floor.  addition, the designer must usually select furniture or design built-in furniture, according to the functions that need to be served.

**Section V  English-Chinese Translation**

Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. (15 points)

(71) The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind; it is simply the mode by which all phenomena are reasoned about and given precise and exact explanation. There is no more difference, but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely graded weights. (72) It is not that the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but that the latter is a much finer apparatus and of course much more accurate in its measurement than the former.

You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar examples. (73) You have all heard it repeated that men of science work by means of induction (归纳法) and deduction, that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, manage to extract from Nature certain natural laws, and that out of these, by some special skill of their own, they build up their theories. (74) And it is imagined by many that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special training. To hear all these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every hour of your lives.

There is a well-known incident in one of Moliere’s plays, where the author makes the hero express unbounded delight on being told that he had been talking prose (散文) during the whole of his life. In the same way, I trust that you will take comfort, and be delighted with yourselves, on the discovery that you have been acting on the principles of inductive and deductive philosophy during the same period. (75) Probably there is not one here who has not in the course of the day had occasion to set in motion a complex train of reasoning, of the very same kind, though differing in degree, as that which a scientific man goes through in tracing the causes of natural phenomena.

**Section II Reading Comprehension**

Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For each question four answers are given. Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (30 points)

**Text 1**

It is all very well to blame traffic jams, the cost of petrol and the quick pace of modern life, but manners on the roads are becoming horrible. Everybody knows that the nicest men become monsters behind the wheel. It is very well, again, to have a tiger in the tank, but to have one in the driver’s seat is another matter altogether. You might tolerate the odd road-hog, the rude and inconsiderate driver, but nowadays the well-mannered motorist is the exception to the rule. Perhaps the situation calls for a “Be Kind to Other Drivers” campaign, otherwise it may get completely out of hand.

Road politeness is not only good manners, but good sense too. It takes the most cool-headed and good-tempered of drivers to resist the temptation to revenge when subjected to uncivilized behavior. On the other hand, a little politeness goes a long way towards relieving the tensions of motoring. A friendly nod or a wave of acknowledgement in response to an act of politeness helps to create an atmosphere of goodwill and tolerance so necessary in modern traffic conditions. But such acknowledgements of politeness are all too rare today. Many drivers nowadays don’t even seem able to recognize politeness when they see it.

However, misplaced politeness can also be dangerous. Typical examples are the driver who brakes violently to allow a car to emerge from a side street at some hazard to following traffic, when a few seconds later the road would be clear anyway; or the man who waves a child across a zebra crossing into the path of oncoming vehicles that may be unable to stop in time. The same goes for encouraging old ladies to cross the road wherever and whenever they care to. It always amazes me that the highways are not covered with the dead bodies of these grannies.

A veteran driver, whose manners are faultless, told me it would help if motorists learnt to filter correctly into traffic streams one at a time without causing the total blockages that give rise to bad temper. Unfortunately, modern motorists can’t even learn to drive, let alone master the subtler aspects of boatmanship. Years ago the experts warned us that the car-ownership explosion would demand a lot more give-and-take from all road users. It is high time for all of us to take this message to heart.

\31. According to this passage, troubles on the road are primarily caused by ________.

[A] people’s attitude towards the road-hog

[B] the rhythm of modern life

[C] the behavior of the driver（C）

[D] traffic conditions

\32. The sentence “You might tolerate the odd road-hog... the rule.” (Para. 1) implies that ________.

[A] our society is unjust towards well-mannered motorists

[B] rude drivers can be met only occasionally

[C] the well-mannered motorist cannot tolerate the road-hog（D）

[D] nowadays impolite drivers constitute the majority of motorists

\33. By “good sense,” the writer means ________.

[A] the driver’s ability to understand and react reasonably

[B] the driver’s prompt response to difficult and severe conditions

[C] the driver’s tolerance of rude or even savage behavior（A）

[D] the driver’s acknowledgement of politeness and regulations

\34. Experts have long pointed out that in the face of car-ownership explosion, ________.

[A] road users should make more sacrifice

[B] drivers should be ready to yield to each other

[C] drivers should have more communication among themselves（B）

[D] drivers will suffer great loss if they pay no respect to others

\35. In the writer’s opinion, ________.

[A] strict traffic regulations are badly needed

[B] drivers should apply road politeness properly

[C] rude drivers should be punished（B）

[D] drivers should avoid traffic jams

**Text 2**

In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts rather like a one-way mirror -- the glass in the roof of a greenhouse which allows the sun’s rays to enter but prevents the heat from escaping.

According to a weather expert’s prediction, the atmosphere will be 3℃ warmer in the year 2050 than it is today, if man continues to burn fuels at the present rate. If this warming up took place, the ice caps in the poles would begin to melt, thus raising sea level several metres and severely flooding coastal cities. Also, the increase in atmospheric temperature would lead to great changes in the climate of the northern hemisphere, possibly resulting in an alteration of earth’s chief food-growing zones.

In the past, concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet. But the weather experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic, which may be affected by only a few degrees of warming: in other words, by a warming on the scale that will possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels.

Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing. The evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place. This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth.

However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere, where temperatures seem to be falling. Scientists conclude, therefore, that up to now natural influences on the weather have exceeded those caused by man. The question is: Which natural cause has most effect on the weather?

One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun. Astronomers at one research station have studied the hot spots and “cold” spots (that is, the relatively less hot spots) on the sun. As the sun rotates, every 27.5 days, it presents hotter or “colder” faces to the earth, and different aspects to different parts of the earth. This seems to have a considerable effect on the distribution of the earth’s atmospheric pressure, and consequently on wind circulation. The sun is also variable over a long term: its heat output goes up and down in cycles, the latest trend being downward.

Scientists are now finding mutual relations between models of solar-weather interactions and the actual climate over many thousands of years, including the last Ice Age. The problem is that the models are predicting that the world should be entering a new Ice Age and it is not. One way of solving this theoretical difficulty is to assume a delay of thousands of years while the solar effects overcome the inertia (惯性) of the earth’s climate. If this is right, the warming effect of carbon dioxide might thus be serving as a useful counter-balance to the sun’s diminishing heat.

 

\36. It can be concluded that a concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would ________.

[A] prevent the sun’s rays from reaching the earth’s surface

[B] mean a warming up in the Arctic

[C] account for great changes in the climate in the northern hemisphere（D）

[D] raise the temperature of the earth’s surface

\37. The article was written to explain ________.

[A] the greenhouse effect

[B] the solar effects on the earth

[C] the models of solar-weather interactions（D）

[D] the causes affecting weather

\38. Although the fuel consumption is greater in the northern hemisphere, temperatures there seem to be falling. This is ________.

[A] mainly because the levels of carbon dioxide are rising

[B] possible because the ice caps in the poles are melting

[C] exclusively due to the effect of the inertia of the earth’s climate（D）

**Text 3**

Some people believe that international sport creates goodwill between the nations and that if countries play games together they will learn to live together. Others say that the opposite is true: that international contests encourage false national pride and lead to misunderstanding and hatred. There is probably some truth in both arguments, but in recent years the Olympic Games have done little to support the view that sports encourages international brotherhood. Not only was there the tragic incident involving the murder of athletes, but the Games were also ruined by lesser incidents caused principally by minor national contests.

One country received its second-place medals with visible indignation after the hockey (曲棍球) final. There had been noisy scenes at the end of the hockey match, the losers objecting to the final decisions. They were convinced that one of their goals should not have been disallowed and that their opponents’ victory was unfair. Their manager was in a rage when he said: “This wasn’t hockey. Hockey and the International Hockey Federation are finished.” The president of the Federation said later that such behavior could result in the suspension of the team for at least three years.

The American basketball team announced that they would not yield first place to Russia, after a disputable end to their contest. The game had ended in disturbance. It was thought at first that the United States had won, by a single point, but it was announced that there were three seconds still to play. A Russian player then threw the ball from one end of the court to the other, and another player popped it into the basket. It was the first time the USA had ever lost an Olympic basketball match. An appeal jury debated the matter for four and a half hours before announcing that the result would stand. The American players then voted not to receive the silver medals.

Incidents of this kind will continue as long as sport is played competitively rather than for the love of the game. The suggestion that athletes should compete as individuals, or in non-national teams, might be too much to hope for. But in the present organization of the Olympics there is far too much that encourages aggressive patriotism.

\41. According to the author, recent Olympic Games have ________.

[A] created goodwill between the nations

[B] bred only false national pride

[C] barely showed any international friendship（C）

[D] led to more and more misunderstanding and hatred

\42. What did the manager mean by saying, “... Hockey and the International Hockey Federation are finished”?

[B] Hockey and the Federation are both ruined by the unfair decisions.

[C] There should be no more hockey matches organized by the Federation.（B）

[D] The Federation should be dissolved.

 

\43. The basketball example implied that ________.

[A] too much patriotism was displayed in the incident

[B] the announcement to prolong the match was wrong

[C] the appeal jury was too hesitant in making the decision（A）

[D] the American team was right in rejecting the silver medals

\44. The author gives the two examples in Paragraphs 2 and 3 to show ________.

[A] how false national pride led to undesirable incidents in international games

[B] that sportsmen have been more obedient than they used to be

**Section V  English-Chinese Translation**

“Intelligence” at best is an assumptive construct -- the meaning of the word has never been clear. (71) There is more agreement on the kinds of behavior referred to by the term than there is on how to interpret or classify them. But it is generally agreed that a person of high intelligence is one who can grasp ideas readily, make distinctions, reason logically, and make use of verbal and mathematical symbols in solving problems. An intelligence test is a rough measure of a child’s capacity for learning, particularly for learning the kinds of things required in school. It does not measure character, social adjustment, physical endurance, manual skills, or artistic abilities. It is not supposed to -- it was not designed for such purposes. (72) To criticize it for such failure is roughly comparable to criticizing a thermometer for not measuring wind velocity.

The other thing we have to notice is that the assessment of the intelligence of any subject is essentially a comparative affair.

(73) Now since the assessment of intelligence is a comparative matter we must be sure that the scale with which we are comparing our subjects provides a “valid” or “fair” comparison. It is here that some of the difficulties which interest us begin. Any test performed involves at least three factors: the intention to do one’s best, the knowledge required for understanding what you have to do, and the intellectual ability to do it. (74) The first two must be equal for all who are being compared, if any comparison in terms of intelligence is to be made. In school populations in our culture these assumptions can be made fair and reasonable, and the value of intelligence testing has been proved thoroughly. Its value lies, of course, in its providing a satisfactory basis for prediction. No one is in the least interested in the marks a little child gets on his test; what we are interested in is whether we can conclude from his mark on the test that the child will do better or worse than other children of his age at tasks which we think require “general intelligence.”

(75) On the whole such a conclusion can be drawn with a certain degree of confidence, but only if the child can be assumed to have had the same attitude towards the test as the others with whom he is being compared, and only if he was not punished by lack of relevant information which they possessed.

For A Better Understanding Between Parent And Child

Nowadays, there is often a lack of understanding between parent and child. One generation often feels that its style of life is different from another generation’s style. The feeling that each family unit should have a separate residence is characteristic. No one wants to intrude or be intruded upon. Both parents and child feel that the other’s presence would upset and change the normal routine.

One of the reasons for present situation is that there are different likes and dislikes between parents and child. For example, the child likes glittering disco, rock-and-roll music or loves movies for his entertainment at night while the parents like peaceful environment and physical exercises. They would like to spend their evenings of life in happiness.

Secondly, there often exists misunderstanding between parent and child. The child doesn’t know what his parent thinks and acts, while the parent doesn’t understand what his children want to do. In general, young people enjoy a great deal of freedom, while their parents always keep their traditional style of life.

Thirdly, children often do not feel an equal share of responsibility toward their parents. For example, a brother sometimes feels that his sisters are responsible for physical care of their parents. One child may resent another’s reluctance to help, provoking misunderstanding and bitterness. Not all of the children may be financially capable of contributing an equal share to the cost of their parent’s care.

I argue that it is unfair to say that they are self-centered. Parent and child should often communicate each other. By discovering things about both sides, they can interact much better and help each other to deal with their problems for a better understanding between parents and child.

**Section II Reading Comprehension**

Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For each question four answers are given. Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (30 points)

**Text 1**

A wise man once said that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people.

Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability.

Accountability isn’t hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences.

Of the many values that hold civilization together -- honesty, kindness, and so on -- accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law -- and, ultimately, no society.

My job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on people’s behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and embarrassment.

Fortunately there are still communities -- smaller towns, usually -- where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that proclaim: “In this family certain things are not tolerated -- they simply are not done!”

Yet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including your life if you enrage him.

The main cause of this break-down is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it’s the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged upbringing, by the school that didn’t teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn’t provide a stable home.

I don’t believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, even partly, from accountability, we become a society of endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything.

We in America desperately need more people who believe that the person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it.

\31. What the wise man said suggests that ________.

[A] it’s unnecessary for good people to do anything in face of evil

[B] it’s certain that evil will prevail if good men do nothing about it

[C] it’s only natural for virtue to defeat evil（B）

[D] it’s desirable for good men to keep away from evil

\32. According to the author, if a person is found guilty of a crime, ________.

[A] society is to be held responsible

[B] modern civilization is responsible for it

[C] the criminal himself should bear the blame（C）

[D] the standards of living should be improved

\33. Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities have ________.

[A] less self-discipline

[B] better sense of discipline

[C] more mutual respect（A）

[D] less effective government

\34. The writer is sorry to have noticed that ________.

[A] people in large cities tend to excuse criminals

[B] people in small towns still stick to old discipline and standards

[C] today’s society lacks sympathy for people in difficulty（A）

[D] people in disadvantaged circumstances are engaged in criminal activities

\35. The key point of the passage is that ________.

[A] stricter discipline should be maintained in schools and families

[B] more good examples should be set for people to follow

[C] more restrictions should be imposed on people’s behavior（D）

[D] more people should accept the value of accountability

**Text 2**

The period of adolescence, i.e., the period between childhood and adulthood, may be long or short, depending on social expectations and on society’s definition as to what constitutes maturity and adulthood. In primitive societies adolescence is frequently a relatively short period of time, while in industrial societies with patterns of prolonged education coupled with laws against child labor, the period of adolescence is much longer and may include most of the second decade of one’s life. Furthermore, the length of the adolescent period and the definition of adulthood status may change in a given society as social and economic conditions change. Examples of this type of change are the disappearance of the frontier in the latter part of the nineteenth century in the United States, and more universally, the industrialization of an agricultural society.

In modern society, ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition and symbolic significance and there no longer is agreement as to what constitutes initiation ceremonies. Social ones have been replaced by a sequence of steps that lead to increased recognition and social status. For example, grade school graduation, high school graduation and college graduation constitute such a sequence, and while each step implies certain behavioral changes and social recognition, the significance of each depends on the socio-economic status and the educational ambition of the individual. Ceremonies for adolescence have also been replaced by legal definitions of status roles, rights, privileges and responsibilities. It is during the nine years from the twelfth birthday to the twenty-first that the protective and restrictive aspects of childhood and minor status are removed and adult privileges and responsibilities are granted. The twelve-year-old is no longer considered a child and has to pay full fare for train, airplane, theater and movie tickets. Basically, the individual at this age loses childhood privileges without gaining significant adult rights. At the age of sixteen the adolescent is granted certain adult rights which increases his social status by providing him with more freedom and choices. He now can obtain a driver’s license; he can leave public schools; and he can work without the restrictions of child labor laws. At the age of eighteen the law provides adult responsibilities as well as rights; the young man can now be a soldier, but he also can marry without parental permission. At the age of twenty-one the individual obtains his full legal rights as an adult. He now can vote, he can buy liquor, he can enter into financial contracts, and he is entitled to run for public office. No additional basic rights are acquired as a function of age after majority status has been attained. None of these legal provisions determine at what point adulthood has been reached but they do point to the prolonged period of adolescence.

\36. The period of adolescence is much longer in industrial societies because ________.

[A] the definition of maturity has changed

[B] the industrialized society is more developed

[C] more education is provided and laws against child labor are made（C）

[B] social recognition

[C] socio-economic status（A）

[D] certain behavioral changes

\38. No one can expect to fully enjoy the adulthood privileges until he is ________.

[A] eleven years old

[B] sixteen years old

[C] twenty-one years old（C）

[D] between twelve and twenty-one years old

[B] the older one becomes, the more basic rights he will have

[C] one won’t get more basic rights than when he is 21（C）

[C] one is considered to have reached adulthood when he has a driver’s license（A）

[D] one is not free from the restrictions of child labor laws until he can join the army

**Text 3**

Most growing plants contain much more water than all other materials combined. C. R. Barnes has suggested that it is as proper to term the plant a water structure as to call a house composed mainly of brick a brick building. Certain it is that all essential processes of plant growth and development occur in water. The mineral elements from the soil that are usable by the plant must be dissolved in the soil solution before they can be taken into the root. They are carried to all parts of the growing plant and are built into essential plant materials while in a dissolved state. The carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air may enter the leaf as a gas but is dissolved in water in the leaf before it is combined with a part of the water to form simple sugars -- the base material from which the plant body is mainly built. Actively growing plant parts are generally 75 to 90 percent water. Structural parts of plants, such as woody stems no longer actively growing, may have much less water than growing tissues.

The actual amount of water in the plant at any one time, however, is only a very small part of what passes through it during its development. The processes of photosynthesis, by which carbon dioxide and water are combined -- in the presence of chlorophyll (叶绿素) and with energy derived from light -- to form sugars, require that carbon dioxide from the air enter the plant. This occurs mainly in the leaves. The leaf surface is not solid but contains great numbers of minute openings, through which the carbon dioxide enters. The same structure that permits the one gas to enter the leaf, however, permits another gas -- water vapor -- to be lost from it. Since carbon dioxide is present in the air only in trace quantities (3 to 4 parts in 10,000 parts of air) and water vapor is near saturation in the air spaces within the leaf (at 80℉, saturated air would contain about 186 parts of water vapor in 10,000 parts of air), the total amount of water vapor lost is many times the carbon dioxide intake. Actually, because of wind and other factors, the loss of water in proportion to carbon dioxide intake may be even greater than the relative concentrations of the two gases. Also, not all of the carbon dioxide that enters the leaf is synthesized into carbohydrates (碳水化合物).

\41. A growing plant needs water for all of the following except ________.

[A] forming sugars

[B] sustaining woody stems

[C] keeping green（D）

[D] producing carbon dioxide

\42. The essential function of photosynthesis in terms of plant needs is ________.

[A] to form sugars

[B] to derive energy from light

[C] to preserve water（A）

[D] to combine carbon dioxide with water

\43. The second paragraph uses facts to develop the essential idea that ________.

[A] a plant efficiently utilizes most of the water it absorbs

[B] carbon dioxide is the essential substance needed for plant development

[C] a plant needs more water than is found in its composition（C）

[D] the stronger the wind, the more the water vapor loss

\44. According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?

[A] The mineral elements will not be absorbed by the plant unless they are dissolved in its root.

[B] The woody stems contain more water than the leaves.

[C] Air existing around the leaf is found to be saturated.（D）

[D] Only part of the carbon dioxide in the plants is synthesized.

\45. This passage is mainly about ________.

[A] the functions of carbon dioxide and water

[B] the role of water in a growing plant

[C] the process of simple sugar formation（B）

[D] the synthesis of water with carbon dioxide

When television first began to expand, very few of the people who had become famous as radio commentators were able to be equally effective on television. Some of the difficulties they experienced when they were trying to  themselves to the new medium were technical. When working  radio, for example, they had become  to seeing on behalf of the listener.

This  of seeing for others means that the commentator has to be very good at talking.  all, he has to be able to  a continuous sequence of visual images which  meaning to the sounds which the listener hears. In the  of television, however, the commentator sees everything with the viewer. His role, therefore, is  different. He is there to make  that the viewer does not miss some point of interest, to help him  on particular things, and to  the images on the television screen.  his radio colleague, he must know the  of silence and how to use it at those moments  the pictures speak for themselves.

The fact is that the energy crisis, which has suddenly been officially announced, has been with us for a long time now, and will be with us for an even longer time. Whether Arab oil flows freely or not, it is clear to everyone that world industry cannot be allowed to depend on so fragile a base. (71) The supply of oil can be shut off unexpectedly at any time, and in any case, the oil wells will all run dry in thirty years or so at the present rate of use.

(72) New sources of energy must be found, and this will take time, but it is not likely to result in any situation that will ever restore that sense of cheap and plentiful energy we have had in the times past. For an indefinite period from here on, mankind is going to advance cautiously, and consider itself lucky that it can advance at all.

To make the situation worse, there is as yet no sign that any slowing of the world’s population is in sight. Although the birth-rate has dropped in some nations, including the United States, the population of the world seems sure to pass six billion and perhaps even seven billion as the twenty-first century opens.

(73) The food supply will not increase nearly enough to match this, which means that we are heading into a crisis in the matter of producing and marketing food.

Taking all this into account, what might we reasonably estimate supermarkets to be like in the year 2001?

To begin with, the world food supply is going to become steadily tighter over the next thirty years -- even here in the United States. By 2001, the population of the United States will be at least two hundred fifty million and possibly two hundred seventy million, and the nation will find it difficult to expand food production to fill the additional mouths. (74) This will be particularly true since energy pinch will make it difficult to continue agriculture in the high-energy American fashion that makes it possible to combine few farmers with high yields.

It seems almost certain that by 2001 the United States will no longer be a great food-exporting nation and that, if necessity forces exports, it will be at the price of belt-tightening at home.

In fact, as food items will tend to decline in quality and decrease in variety, there is very likely to be increasing use of flavouring additives. (75) Until such time as mankind has the sense to lower its population to the point where the planet can provide a comfortable support for all, people will have to accept more “unnatural food”.

In May 1989, space shuttle “Atlantis” released in outer space the space probe “Megallan,” which is now on her 15-month and one-billion-kilometer flight to Venus. A new phase in space exploration has begun.

The planet Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth; it is the only other object in the solar system, in fact, that even comes close to earth’s size. Venus has a similar density, so it is probably made of approximately the same stuff, and it has an atmosphere, complete with clouds. It is also the closest planet to earth, and thus the most similar in distance from the sun. In short, Venus seems to justify its long-held nickname of “earth’s twin.”

The surface temperature of Venus reaches some 900F. Added to that is an atmospheric pressure about 90 times Earth’s: High overhead in the carbon dioxide (CO2) that passes for air is a layer of clouds, perhaps 10 to 20  miles thick, whose little drops consist mostly of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Water is all but nonexistent.

Born with so many fundamental similarities to earth, how did Venus get to be so radically different: It is not just an academic matter. For all its extremes, Venus is a valuable laboratory for researchers studying the weather and climate of earth. It has no earth’s oceans, so the heat transport and other mechanisms are greatly simplified. In addition, the planet Venus takes 243 earth-days to turn once on its axis, so incoming heat from the sun is added and distributed at a more leisurely, observable pace.

\16. Venus is similar to Earth in ________.

[A] size and density

[B] distance from the sun

[C] having atmosphere（D）

[D] all of the above

\17. The greatest value in studying Venus should be to ________.

[A] allow us to visit there

[B] understand Earth better

[C] find a new source of energy（B）

[D] promote a new space program

\18. The main idea of this passage is about ________.

[A] problems of space travel

[B] scientific methods in space exploration

[C] the importance of Venus to Earth（C）

[D] conditions on Venus

Tourists were surprised to see a woman driving a huge orange tractor down one of Rome’s main avenues. Italy’s political leaders and some of its male union chiefs are said to have been even more puzzled to see that the tractor was followed by about 200,000 women in a parading procession that took more than three hours to snake through central Rome.

Shouting slogans, waving flags and dancing to drumbeats, the women had come to the capital from all over Italy to demonstrate for “a job for each of us, a different type of job, and a society without violence.” So far, action to improve women’s opportunities in employment has been the province of collective industrial bargaining. “But there is a growing awareness that this is not enough,” says a researcher on female labor at the government-funded Institute for the Development of Professional Training for Workers.

Women, who constitute 52 per cent of Italy’s population, today represent only 35 per cent of Italy’s total workforce and 33 per cent of the total number of Italians with jobs. However, their presence in the workplace is growing. The employment of women is expanding considerably in services, next to the public administration and commerce as their principal workplace. Official statistics also show that women have also made significant strides in self-employment. More and more women are going into business for themselves. Many young women are turning to business because of the growing overall in employment. It is also a fact that today many prejudices have disappeared, so that banks and other financial institutes make judgments on purely business considerations without caring if it is a man or a woman.

Such changes are occurring in the professions too. The number of women doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers and university professors increased two to three fold. Some of the changes are immediately visible. For example, women have appeared on the scene for the first time as state police, railway workers and street cleaners.

However, the present situation is far from satisfactory though some progress has been made. A breakthrough in equal opportunities for women is now demanded.

\19. The expression “snake through central Rome” probably means “to move ________

[A] quietly through central Rome.”

[B] violently through central Rome.”

[C] in a long winding line through central Rome.”（C）

[D] at a leisurely pace through central Rome.”

\20. Which of the following statements is NOT true?

[A] There are more women than men in Italy.

[B] In Italy, women are chiefly employed in services.

[C] In Italy, women are still at a disadvantage in employment.（B）

[D] In Italy, about two-thirds of the jobs are held by men.

\21. About 200,000 women in Rome demonstrated for ________.

[A] more job opportunities

[B] a greater variety of jobs

[C] “equal job, equal pay”（D）

[D] both A and B

\22. The best title for this passage would be ________.

[A] The Role of Women is Society

[B] Women Demonstrate for Equality in Employment

[C] Women as Self-employed Professionals（B）

[D] Women and the Jobs Market

The old idea that talented children “burn themselves out” in the early years, and, therefore, are subjected to failure and at worst, mental illness is unfounded. As a matter of fact, the outstanding thing that happens to bright kids is that they are very likely to grow into bright adults.

To find this out, l, 500 gifted persons were followed up to their thirty-fifth year with these results:

On adult intelligence tests, they scored as high as they had as children. They were, as a group, in good health, physically and mentally. 84 per cent of their group were married and seemed content with their lives.

About 70 per cent had graduated from college, though only 30 per cent had graduated with honors. A few had even dropped out, but nearly half of these had returned to graduate. Of the men, 80 per cent were in one of the professions or in business management or semiprofessional jobs. The women who had remained single had office, business, or professional occupations.

The group had published 90 books and 1,500 articles in scientific, scholarly, and literary magazines and had collected more than 100 patents.

In a material way they did not do badly either. Average income was considerably higher among the gifted people, especially the men, than for the country as a whole, despite their comparative youth.

In fact, far from being strange, most of the gifted were turning their early promise into practical reality.

\23. The old idea that talented children “burn themselves out” in the early years is ________.

[A] true in all senses

[B] refuted by the author

[C] medically proven（B）

[D] a belief of the author

\24. The survey of bright children was made to ________.

[A] find out what had happened to talented children when they became adults

[B] prove that talented children “burn themselves out” in the early years

[C] discover the percentage of those mentally ill among the gifted（A）

[D] prove that talented children never burn themselves out

\25. Intelligence tests showed that ________.

[A] bright children were unlikely to be mentally healthy

[B] between childhood and adulthood there was a considerable loss of intelligence

[C] talented children were most likely to become gifted adults（C）

[D] when talented children grew into adults, they made low scores

No one knows for sure what the world would be like in the year 2001. Many books have been written  the future. But the 19th-century French novelist Jules Verne may be called a futurologist in the fullest  of the word. In his fantastic novels “A Trip to the Moon” and “80 Days Around the World,” he described with detail the aeroplane and even the helicopter. These novels still have a great attraction  young readers of today because of their bold imagination and scientific accuracy.

Below is a description of what our life will be in the year 2001 as predicted by a  writer.

In 2001, in the home, cookers will be set so that you can cook a complete meal at the touch of a switch.

Television will provide information on prices at the  shops as well as news and entertainment. Videophones will bring pictures as well as  to telephone conversations.

Machines will control temperature, lighting, entertainment, security alarms, laundry and gardening.

Lighting will provide decoration as well as wallpaper.

At work, robots will take  most jobs in the manufacturing industries. Working hours will fall to under 30 hours a week. Holidays will get longer; six weeks will be the normal annual holiday. Men and women will retire at the same age.

Our leisure will be different too. The home will become the center of entertainment through television and electronic games. More people will eat out in restaurants  they do today; also they will have a much wider variety of food available. There will be a change of taste towards a more savoury-flavored menu. New synthetic foods will form a  part of people’s diets.

Foreign travel will ; winter holidays will become more popular than summer ones.

Also non-stop flights from Britain to Australia and New Zealand will be easily available and much cheaper. Education will become increasingly more important than ever before.

**Section VII English-Chinese Translation**

Read the following passage carefully and then translate the sentences underlined into Chinese. (20 points)

People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and behaviors are formed. It is not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another is competitive.

Social scientists are, of course, extremely interested in these types of questions. (61) They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibit certain behaviors. There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the matter have developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other. The controversy is often conveniently referred to as “nature *vs*. nurture.”

(62) Those who support the “nature” side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological factors. (63) That our environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and behavior is central to this theory.

Taken to an extreme, this theory maintains that our behavior is pre-determined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts.

Those who support the “nurture” theory, that is, they advocate education, are often called behaviorists. They claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. A behaviorist, B. F. Skinner, sees humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. (64) The behaviorists maintain that, like machines, humans respond to environmental stimuli as the basis of their behavior.

Let us examine the different explanations about one human characteristic, intelligence, offered by the two theories. (65) Supporters of the “nature” theory insist that we are born with a certain capacity for learning that is biologically determined. Needless to say: They don’t believe that factors in the environment have much influence on what is basically a predetermined characteristic. On the other hand, behaviorists argue that our intelligence levels are the product of our experiences. (66) Behaviorists suggest that the child who is raised in an environment where there are many stimuli which develop his or her capacity for appropriate responses will experience greater intellectual development.

The social and political implications of these two theories are profound. (67) In the United States, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligence tests. This leads some “nature” proponents to conclude that blacks are biologically inferior to whites. (68) Behaviorists, in contrast, say that differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often deprived of many of the educational and other environmental advantages that whites enjoy.

Most people think neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior.

**Text 1**

A scientist once said: “I have concluded that the earth is being visited by intelligently controlled vehicles from outer space.”

If we take this as a reasonable explanation for UFOs (unidentified flying objects), questions immediately come up.

“Why don’t they get in touch with us, then? Why don’t they land right on the White House lawn and declare themselves?” people asked.

In reply, scientists say that, while this may be what we want, it may not necessarily be what they want.

“The most likely explanation, it seems to me,” said Dr. Mead, “is that they are simply watching what we are up to -- that responsible society outside our solar system is keeping an eye on us to see that we don’t set in motion a chain reaction that might have unexpected effects for outside our solar system.”

Opinions from other scientists might go like this: “Why should they want to get in touch with us? We may feel we’re more important than we really are! They may want to observe us only and not interfere with the development of our civilization. They may not care if we see them but they also may not care to say ‘hello’.”

Some scientists have also suggested that Earth is a kind of zoo or wildlife reserve. Just as we set aside wilderness areas and wildlife reserves to allow animals and growing things to develop naturally while we observe them, so perhaps Earth was set aside ages ago for the same purpose.

Are we being observed by intelligent beings from other civilizations in the universe? Are they watching our progress in space travel? Do we live in a gigantic “zoo” observed by our “keepers,” but having no communication with them?

Never before in our history have we had to confront ideas like these. The simple fact is that we, who have always regarded ourselves as supreme in the universe, may not be so. Now we have to recognize that, among the stars in the heavens, there may very well be worlds inhabited by beings who are to us as we are to ants.

\16. People who ask the question “Why don’t they get in touch with us... and declare themselves?” think that ________.

[A] there are no such things as UFOs

[B] UFOs are visitors from solar system

[C] there’s no reason for UFOs sooner or later（A）

[D] we are bound to see UFOs sooner or later

\17. According to Dr. Mead, the attitude of beings from outer space toward us is one of ________.

[A] unfriendliness

[B] suspicion

[C] superiority（B）

[D] hostility

\18. The tone of the writer is that of ________.

[A] doubt

[B] warning

[C] indifference（D）

[D] criticism

**Text 2**

The use of the motor is becoming more and more widespread in the twentieth century; as an increasing number of countries develop both technically and economically, so a larger proportion of the world’s population is able to buy and use a car. Possessing a car gives a much greater degree of mobility, enabling the driver to move around freely. The owner of a car is no longer forced to rely on public transport and is, therefore, not compelled to work locally. He can choose from different jobs and probably changes his work more frequently as he is not restricted to a choice within a small radius. Travelling to work by car is also more comfortable than having to use public transport; the driver can adjust the heating in winter and the air conditioning in the summer to suit his own needs and preference. There is no irritation caused by waiting for trains, buses or underground trains, standing in long patient queues, or sitting on windy platforms, for as long as half an hour sometimes. With the building of good, fast motorways long distances can be covered rapidly and pleasantly. For the first time in this century also, many people are now able to enjoy their leisure time to the full by making trips to the country or seaside at the weekends, instead of being confined to their immediate neighbourhood. This feeling of independence, and the freedom to go where you please, is perhaps the greatest advantage of the car.

When considering the drawbacks, perhaps pollution is of prime importance. As more and more cars are produced and used, so the emission from their exhaust-pipes contains an ever larger volume of poisonous gas. Some of the contents of this gas, such as lead, not only pollute the atmosphere but cause actual harm to the health of people. Many of the minor illnesses of modern industrial society, headaches, tiredness, and stomach upsets are thought to arise from breathing polluted air; doctors’ surgeries are full of people suffering from illnesses caused by pollution. It is also becoming increasingly difficult to deal with the problem of traffic in towns; most of the important cities of the world suffer from traffic congestion. In fact any advantage gained in comfort is often cancelled out in city driving by the frustration caused by traffic jams: endless queues of cars crawling one after another through all the main streets. As an increasing number of traffic regulation schemes are devised, the poor bewildered driver finds himself diverted and forced into one-way systems which cause even greater delays than the traffic jams they are supposed to prevent. The mounting cost of petrol and the increased license fees and road tax all add to the driver’s worries. In fact, he must sometimes wonder if the motor car is such a blessing and not just a menace.

\19. More and more people can afford to buy and use cars because ________.

[A] an increasing number of cars are being produced

[B] the cost of cars is getting cheaper with the development of technology

[C] lots of countries have become more developed（C）

[D] the use of cars has proved to be more economical

\20. The advantages of having a car are best experienced in the driver’s ________.

[A] freedom in choosing his job

[B] comfort during the travels

[C] enjoyment of his leisure time（D）

[D] feeling of self-reliance

\21. What is considered by the writer as the greatest menace to the people caused by the widespread use of motor cars?

[A] air pollution

[B] traffic jams

[C] fatal diseases（A）

[D] high cost

**Text 3**

Manners nowadays in metropolitan cities like London are practically non-existent. It is nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her, as he ought. In fact, it is saddening to note that if a man does offer his seat to an older woman, it is nearly always a Continental man or one from the older generation.

This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued about by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy and that those who go out to work should take their turn in the rat race like anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it is not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for younger women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves “First come, first served,” while a grey-haired woman, a mother with a young child or a cripple stands? Yet this is all too often seen.

Conditions in travel are really very hard on everyone, we know, but hardship is surely no excuse. Sometimes one wonders what would have been the behaviour of these stout young men in a packed refugee train or a train on its way to a prison-camp during the War. Would they have considered it only right and their proper due to keep the best places for themselves then?

Older people, tired and irritable from a day’s work, are not angels, either -- far from it. Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One cannot commend this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little more excuse.

If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems imperative, not only that communications in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. All over cities, it seems that people are too tired and too rushed to be polite. Shop assistants won’t bother to assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductor pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on and so on. It seems to us that it is up to the young and strong to do their small part to stop such deterioration.

\22. From what you have read, would you expect manners to improve among people ________?

[A] who are physically weak or crippled

[B] who once lived in a prison-camp during the War

[C] who live in big modern cities（C）

[D] who live only in metropolitan cities

\23. What is the writer’s opinion concerning courteous manners towards women?

[A] Now that women have claimed equality, they no longer need to be treated differently from men.

[B] It is generally considered old-fashioned for young men to give up their seats to young women.

[C] “Lady First” should be universally practiced.（D）

[D] Special consideration ought to be shown them.

\24. According to the author communication between human beings would be smoother if ________.

[A] people were more considerate towards each other

[B] people were not so tired and irritable

[C] women were treated with more courtesy（A）

[D] public transport could be improved

\25. What is the possible meaning of the word “deterioration” in the last paragraph?

[A] worsening of general situation

[B] lowering of moral standards

[C] declining of physical constitution（B）

[D] spreading of evil conduct

One day drought may be a thing of the past at least in coastal cities. Vast areas of desert throughout the world may for the first time  and provide millions of hectares of land where now nothing grows.

By the end of this century this may not be mere . Scientists are already looking into the possibility of using some of the available ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. In these regions there are vast ice-caps formed by snow that has fallen over the past 50,000 years. Layer  layer of deep snow means that, when melted, the snow water would be pure, not salty as sea-ice would be. There is so much  pure water here that it would need only a fraction of it to turn much of the desert or poorly irrigated parts of the world into rich farmland. And what useful packages it would come in! It should be possible to cut off a bit of ice and transport it! Alternatively perhaps a passing iceberg could be . They are always breaking away from the main caps and floating around, pushed by currents, until they eventually melt and are wasted.

Many icebergs are, of course, far too small to be towed  distance, and would melt before they reached a country that needed them anywhere. It would be necessary to locate one that was  and that was big enough to provide a good supply of ice when it reached us. Engineers think that an iceberg up to seven miles long and one and a half miles wide could be transported if the tug pulling it was as big as a supertanker! Even then they would cover only twenty miles every day. However,  the iceberg was at its destination, more that 7,000 million cubic metres of water could be taken from it! That would probably be more than enough for any medium-sized city even in the hottest summer! But no doubt a use could be found for it. , scientist say, there would not be too much wastage in such a journey. The larger the iceberg, the slower it melts, even if it is towed through the tropics. This is because when the sun has a bigger area to warm , less heat actually gets into the iceberg. The vast frozen centre would be unaffected.

**Section VII English-Chinese Translation**

Read the following passage carefully and then translate the sentences in heavy type into Chinese. (20 points)

When Jane Matheson started work at Advanced Electronics Inc. 12 years ago, (61) she laboured over a microscope, hand-welding tiny electronic computers and turned out 18 per hour. Now she tends the computerized machinery that turns out high capacity memory chips at the rate of 2,600 per hour. Production is up, profits are up, her income is up and Mrs. Matheson says the work is far less strain on her eyes.

But the most significant effect of the changes at AEI was felt by the workers who are no longer there. Before the new computerized equipment was introduced, there were 940 workers at the plant. Now there are 121. (62) A plant follow-up survey showed that one year after the layoffs only 38% of the released workers found new employment at the same or better wages. Nearly half finally settled for lower pay and more than 13% are still out of work. The AEI example is only one of hundreds around the country which forge intelligently ahead into the latest technology, but leave the majority of their workers behind.

(63) Its beginnings obscured by unemployment caused by the world economic slow-down, the new technological unemployment may emerge as the great socio-economic challenge of the end of the 20th century. One corporation economist says the growth of “machine job replacement” has been with us since the beginning of the industrial revolution, but never at the pace it is now. The human costs will be astonishing. (64) “It’s humiliating to be done out of your job by a machine and there is no way to fight back, but it is the effort to find a new job that really hurts.” Some workers, like Jane Matheson, are retrained to handle the new equipment, but often a whole new set of skills is required and that means a new, and invariably smaller set of workers. (65) The old workers, trapped by their limited skills, often never regain their old status and employment. Many drift into marginal areas. They feel no pride in their new work. They get badly paid for it and they feel miserable, but still they are luckier than those who never find it.

(66) The social costs go far beyond the welfare and unemployment payments made by the government. Unemployment increases the chances of divorce, child abuse, and alcoholism, a new federal survey shows. Some experts say the problem is only temporary... that new technology will eventually create as many jobs as it destroys. (67) But futurologist Hymen Seymour says the astonishing efficiency of the new technology means there will be a simple and direct net reduction in the amount of human labor that needs to be done. “We should treat this as an opportunity to give people more leisure. It may not be easy, but society will have to reach a new unanimity on the division and distribution of labor,” Seymour says. He predicts most people will work only six-hour days and four-day weeks by the end of the century. But the concern of the unemployed is for now. (68) Federally funded training and free back-to-school programs for laid-off workers are under way, but few experts believe they will be able to keep up with the pace of the new technology. For the next few years, for a substantial portion of the workforce, times are going to be very tough indeed.

**Section II Reading Comprehension**

Each of the three passages below is followed by some questions. For each question there are four answers. Read the passages carefully and chose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (20 points)

 

**Text 1**

It doesn’t come as a surprise to you to realize that it makes no difference what you read or study if you can’t remember it. You just waste your valuable time. Maybe you have already discovered some clever ways to keep yourself from forgetting.

One dependable aid that does help you remember what you study is to have a specific purpose or reason for reading. You remember better what you read when you know why you’re reading.

Why does a clerk in a store go away and leave you when your reply to her offer to help is, “No, thank you. I’m just looking”? Both you and she know that if you aren’t sure what you want, you are not likely to find it. But suppose you say instead, “Yes, thank you. I want a pair of sun glasses.” She says, “Right this way, please.” And you and she are off -- both eager to look for exactly what you want.

It’s quite the same with your studying. If you chose a book at random, “just looking” for nothing in particular, you are likely to get just that -- nothing. But if you do know what you want, and if you have the right book, you are almost sure to get it. Your reasons will vary; they will include reading or studying “to find out more about”, “to understand the reasons for”, “to find out how”. A good student has a clear purpose or reason for what he is doing.

This is the way it works. Before you start to study, you say to yourself something like this, “I want to know why Stephen Vincent Benet happened to write about America. I’m reading this article to find out.” Or, “I’m going to skim this story to see what life was like in medieval England.” Because you know why you are reading or studying, you relate the information to your purpose and remember it better.

Reading is not one single activity. At least two important processes go on at the same time. As you read, you take in ideas rapidly and accurately. But at the same time you express your own ideas to yourself as you react to what you read. You have a kind of mental conversation with the author. If you expressed your ideas orally, they might sound like this: “Yes, I agree. That’s my opinion too.” or “Ummmm, I thought that record was broken much earlier. I’d better check those dates,” or “But there are some other facts to be considered!” You don’t just sit there taking in ideas -- you do something else, and that something else is very important.

This additional process of thinking about what you read includes evaluating it, relating it to what you already know, and using it for your own purposes. In other words, a good reader is a critical reader. One part of critical reading, as you have discovered, is distinguishing between facts and opinions. Facts can be checked by evidence. Opinions are one’s own personal reactions.

Another part of critical reading is judging sources. Still another part is drawing accurate inferences.

\16. If you cannot remember what you read or study, ________.

[A] it is no surprise

[B] it means you have not really learned anything

[C] it means you have not chosen the right book（B）

[D] you realize it is of no importance

\17. Before you start reading, it is important ________.

[A] to make sure why you are reading

[B] to relate the information to your purpose

[C] to remember what you read（A）

[D] to choose an interesting book

\18. Reading activity involves ________.

[A] only two simultaneous processes

[B] primarily learning about ideas and evaluating them critically

[C] merely distinguishing between facts and opinions（B）

[D] mainly drawing accurate inferences

\19. A good reader is one who ________.

[A] relates what he reads to his own knowledge about the subject matter

[B] does lots of thinking in his reading

[C] takes a critical attitude in his reading（C）

[D] is able to check the facts presented against what he has already known

**Text 2**

If you live in a large city, you are quite familiar with some of the problems of noise, but because of some of its harmful effects, you may not be aware of the extent of its influence on human behavior. Although everyone more or less knows what noise is, i.e., it is sounds that one would rather not hear, it is perhaps best to define it more precisely for scientific purposes. One such definition is that noise is sounds that are unrelated to the task at hand. Thus stimuli that at one time might be considered relevant will at another time be considered noise, depending on what one is doing at the moment. In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the effects of noise on human behavior, and concepts such as “noise pollution” have arisen, together with movements to reduce noise.

Exposure to loud noises can definitely produce a partial or complete loss of hearing, depending on the intensity, duration, and frequency composition of the noise. Many jobs present noise hazards, such as working in factories and around jet aircraft, driving farm tractors, and working (or sitting) in music halls where rock bands are playing. In general, continuous exposure to sounds of over 80 decibels (a measure of the loudness of sound) can be considered dangerous. Decibel values correspond to various sounds. Sounds above about 85 decibels may, if exposure is for a sufficient period of time, produce significant hearing loss. Actual loss will depend upon the particular frequencies to which one is exposed, and whether the sound is continuous or intermittent.

Noise can have unexpected harmful effects on performance of certain kinds of tasks, for instance, if one is performing a watch keeping task that requires vigilance, in which he is responsible for detecting weak signals of some kind (e.g., watching a radar screen for the appearance of aircraft).

Communicating with other people is unfavorably affected by noise. If you have ridden in the rear of a jet transport, you may have noticed that it was difficult to carry on a conversation at first, and that, eventually, you adjusted the loudness of your speech to compensate for the effect. The problem is noise.

\20. Noise differs from sound in that ________.

[A] it is sounds that interfere with the task being done

[B] it is a special type of loud sound

[C] it is usually unavoidable in big cities（A）

[D] it can be defined more precisely than the latter

\21. One of the harmful effects of noise on human performance is that ________.

[A] it reduces one’s sensitivity

[B] it renders the victim helpless

[C] it deprives one of the enjoyment of music（A）

[D] it drowns out conversations at worksites

\22. The purpose of this passage is ________.

[A] to define the effects of noise on human behavior

[B] to warn people of the danger of noise pollution

[C] to give advice as to how to prevent hearing loss（A）

[D] to tell the difference between noise and sound

**Text 3**

The traditional belief that a woman’s place is in the home and that a woman ought not to go out to work can hardly be reasonably maintained in present conditions. It is said that it is a woman’s task to care for the children, but families today tend to be small and with a year or two between children. Thus a woman’s whole period of childbearing may occur within five years. Furthermore, with compulsory education from the age of five or six her role as chief educator of her children soon ceases. Thus, even if we agree that a woman should stay at home to look after her children before they are of school age, for many women, this period would extend only for about ten years.

It might be argued that the house-proud woman would still find plenty to do about the home. That may be so, but it is certainly no longer necessary for a woman to spend her whole life cooking, cleaning, mending and sewing. Washing machines take the drudgery out of laundry, the latest models being entirely automatic and able to wash and dry a large quantity of clothes in a few minutes. Refrigerators have made it possible to store food for long periods and many pre-cooked foods are obtainable in tins. Shopping, instead of being a daily task, can be completed in one day a week. The new man-made fibers are more hardwiring than natural fibers and greatly reduce mending, while good ready-made clothes are cheap and plentiful.

Apart from women’s own happiness, the needs of the community must be considered. Modern society cannot do well without the contribution that women can make in professions and other kinds of work. There is a serious shortage of nurses and teachers, to mention only two of the occupations followed by women. It is extremely wasteful to give years of training at public expense only to have the qualified teacher or nurse marry after a year or two and be lost forever to her profession. The training, it is true, will help her in duties as a mother, but if she continued to work, her service would be more widely useful. Many factories and shops, too, are largely staffed by women, many of them married. While here the question of training is not so important, industry and trade would be seriously short of staff if married women did not work.

\23. The author holds that ________.

[A] the right place for all women, married or otherwise, is the home, not elsewhere

[B] all married women should have some occupation outside the home

[C] a married woman should give first priority to her duties as a mother（B）

[D] it is desirable for uneducated married women to stay at home and take care of the family

\24. A house-proud woman ________.

[A] would devote her whole life to her family

[B] would take her own happiness and that of her family as her chief concern

[C] would still need some special training at public expense to help her in her duties as a housewife（D）

[D] would take full advantage of modern household appliances

\25. According to the author, modern society ________.

[A] can operate just as well even without women participation

[B] has been greatly hampered in its development by the shortage of women nurses and women teachers

[C] cannot operate properly without the contribution of women（C）

[D] will be seriously affected by the continuing shortage of working women in heavy industries and international trade

In 1620, a small sailboat named the *Mayflower* left England for the New World. The *Mayflower* headed for the Jamestown colony on the warm shore of Virginia. Its one hundred passengers were the Pilgrims. They were looking for a place where they could worship God . Because of strong winds and severe storms, the *Mayflower* lost its . The brave group of colonists finally had to land at Plymouth on the rocky coast of Massachusetts in December 1620. It was the middle of the stern northern winter.  months of starvation, disease, and death were ahead of them. Only the strongest of the pilgrims  that winter.

They had eleven crude houses for protection against the severe winter. Seven were for families, and four were for communal use. , they had established a treaty of friendship with their Indian neighbors under Chief Massasoit in the summer.

**Section VII English-Chinese Translation**

Translate the following passage into Chinese. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)

Seated behind the front desk at a New York firm, the receptionist was efficient.

Stylishly dressed, the firm’s newest employee had a pleasant telephone voice and a natural charm that put clients at ease. The company was pleased: (61) Clearly, this was a person who took considerable pride in personal appearance. David King, the receptionist, is unusual, but by no means unique. (62) Just as all truck drivers and construction workers are no longer necessarily men, all secretaries and receptionists are no longer automatically women. The number of men in women-dominated fields is still small and they haven’t attracted the attention that has often followed women advancing into male-dominated fields, but men are moving into more and more jobs that have traditionally been held by women.

Strictly speaking, the phenomenon is not new. For the past several decades, men have been quietly entering fields such as nursing, social work and elementary education. But today no job seems off-limits. Men serve coffee in offices and meals on airplanes. (63) These changes are helping to influence some of the long-standing traditions about the types of work men and women can do -- but they also produce some undeniable problems for the men who are entering those fields formerly dominated by women.

What kinds of men venture into these so-called “women’s fields”? All kinds. (64) “I don’t know of any definite answers I’d be comfortable with,” explains Joseph Pleck, Ph.D., of the Wellesley College Centre for Research on Women.

Sam Ormont, for example, a thirty-year-old nurse at a Boston hospital, went into nursing because the army had trained him as a medical worker. (65) “I found that work very interesting.” he recalled, “and when I got out of the service it just seemed natural for me to go into something medical. I wasn’t really interested in becoming a doctor.” Thirty-five-year-old David King, an out-of-work actor, found a job as a receptionist because he was having trouble landing roles in Broadway plays and he needed to pay the rent.

(66) In other words, men enter “female” jobs out of the same consideration for personal interest and economic necessity that motivates anyone looking for work. But similarities often end there. Men in female-dominated jobs are conspicuous. As a group, their work histories differ in most respects from those of their female colleagues, and they are frequently treated differently by the people with whom they are in professional contact.

The question naturally arises: Why are there still approximately ninety-nine female secretaries for every one male? There is also a more serious issue. Most men don’t want to be receptionists, nurses, secretaries or sewing workers. Put simply, these are not generally considered very masculine jobs. (67) To choose such a line of work is to invite ridicule.

“There was kidding in the beginning,” recalls Ormont. “Kids coming from school ask what I am, and when I say ‘A nurse,’ they laugh at me. I just smile and say, ‘You know, there are female doctors, too.’”

Still, there are encouraging signs. Years ago, male grade school teachers were as rare as male nurses. Today more than one elementary school teacher in six is male.

(68) Can we anticipate a day when secretaries will be an even mix of men and women -- or when the mention of a male nurse will no longer raise eyebrows? It’s probably coming -- but not very soon.

Each of three passages below is followed by five questions. For each question there are four answers, read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (15 points)

**Text 1**

For centuries men dreamed of achieving vertical flight. In 400 A.D. Chinese children played with a fan-like toy that spun upwards and fell back to earth as rotation ceased. Leonardo da Vinci conceive the first mechanical apparatus, called a “Helix,” which could carry man straight up, but was only a design and was never tested.

The ancient-dream was finally realized in 1940 when a Russian engineer piloted a strange looking craft of steel tubing with a rotating fan on top. It rose awkwardly and vertically into the air from a standing start, hovered a few feet above the ground, went sideways and backwards, and then settled back to earth. The vehicle was called a helicopter.

Imaginations were fired. Men dreamed of going to work in their own personal helicopters. People anticipate that vertical flight transports would carry millions of passengers as do the airliners of today. Such fantastic expectations were not fulfilled.

The helicopter has now become an extremely useful machine. It excels in military missions, carrying troops, guns and strategic instruments where other aircraft cannot go. Corporations use them as airborne offices, many metropolitan areas use them in police work, construction and logging companies employ them in various advantageous ways, engineers use them for site selection and surveying, and oil companies use them as the best way to make offshore and remote work stations accessible to crews and supplies. Any urgent mission to a hard-to-get-to place is a likely task for a helicopter. Among their other multitude of used: deliver people across town, fly to and from airports, assist in rescue work, and aid in the search for missing or wanted persons.

\11. People expect that ________.

[A] the airliners of today would eventually be replaced by helicopters

[B] helicopters would someday be able to transport large number of people from place to place as airliners are now doing

[C] the imaginations fired by the Russian engineer’s invention would become a reality in the future（B）

[D] their fantastic expectations about helicopters could be fulfilled by airliners of today

 

\12. Helicopters work with the aid of ________.

[A] a combination of rotating devices in front and on top

[B] a rotating device topside

[C] one rotating fan in the center of the aircraft and others at each end（B）

[D] a rotating fan underneath for lifting

\13. What is said about the development of the helicopter?

[A] Helicopters have only been worked on by man since 1940.

[B] Chinese children were the first to achieve flight in helicopters.

[C] Helicopters were considered more dangerous than the early airplanes.（D）

[D] Some people thought they would become widely used by average individuals.

\14. How has the use of helicopters developed?

[A] They have been widely used for various purposes.

[B] They are taking the place of high-flying jets.

[C] They are used for rescue work.（A）

[D] They are now used exclusively for commercial projects.

\15. Under what conditions are helicopters found to be absolutely essential?

[A] For overseas passenger transportation.

[B] For extremely high altitude flights.

[C] For high-speed transportation.（D）

[D] For urgent mission to places inaccessible to other kinds of craft.

**Text 2**

In ancient Greece athletic festivals were very important and had strong religious associations. The Olympian athletic festival held every four years in honor of Zeus, king of the Olympian Gods, eventually lost its local character, became first a national event and then, after the rules against foreign competitors had been abolished, international. No one knows exactly how far back the Olympic Games go, but some official records date from 776 B.C. The games took place in August on the plain by Mount Olympus. Many thousands of spectators gathered from all parts of Greece, but no married woman was admitted even as a spectator. Slaves, women and dishonored persons were not allowed to compete. The exact sequence of events uncertain, but events included boy’s gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, horse racing and field events, though there were fewer sports involved than in the modern Olympic Games.

On the last day of the Games, all the winners were honored by having a ring of holy olive leaves placed on their heads. So great was the honor that the winner of the foot race gave his name to the year of his victory. Although Olympic winners received no prize money, they were, in fact, richly rewarded by their state authorities. How their results compared with modern standards, we unfortunately have no means of telling.

After an uninterrupted history of almost 1,200 years, the Games were suspended by the Romans in 394 A.D. They continued for such a long time because people believed in the philosophy behind the Olympics: the idea that a healthy body produced a healthy mind, and that the spirit of competition in sports and games was preferable to the competition that caused wars. It was over 1,500 years before another such international athletic gathering took place in Athens in 1896.

Nowadays, the Games are held in different countries in turn. The host country provides vast facilities, including a stadium, swimming pools and living accommodation, but competing courtiers pay their own athletes’ expenses.

The Olympics start with the arrival in the stadium of a torch, lighted on Mount Olympus by the sun’s rays. It is carried by a succession of runners to the stadium. The torch symbolized the continuation of the ancient Greek athletic ideals, and it burns throughout the Games until the closing ceremony. The well-known Olympic flag, however, is a modern conception: the five interlocking rings symbolize the uniting of all five continents participating in the Games.

\16. In ancient Greece, the Olympic Games ________.

[A] were merely national athletic festivals

[B] were in the nature of a national event with a strong religious colour

[C] had rules which put foreign participants in a disadvantageous position（B）

[D] were primarily national events with few foreign participants

\17. In the early days of ancient Olympic Games ________.

[A] only male Greek athletes were allowed to participate in the games

[B] all Greeks, irrespective of sex, religion or social status, were allowed to take part

[C] all Greeks, with the exception of women, were allowed to compete in Games（A）

[D] all male Greeks were qualified to compete in the Games

\18. The order of athletic events at the ancient Olympics ________.

[B] they are much better

[C] by the athletes themselves（B）

[D] by contributions

**Text 3**

In science the meaning of the word “explain” suffers with civilization’s every step in search of reality. Science cannot really explain electricity, magnetism, and gravitation; their effects can be measured and predicted, but of their nature no more is known to the modern scientist than to Thales who first looked into the nature of the electrification of amber, a hard yellowish-brown gum. Most contemporary physicists reject the notion that man can ever discover what these mysterious forces “really” are. “Electricity,” Bertrand Russell says, “is not a thing, like St. Paul’s Cathedral; it is a way in which things behave. When we have told how things behave when they are electrified, and under what circumstances they are electrified, we have told all there is to tell.” Until recently scientists would have disapproved of such an idea. Aristotle, for example, whose natural science dominated Western thought for two thousand years, believed that man could arrive at an understanding of reality by reasoning from self-evident principles. He felt, for example, that it is a self-evident principle that everything in the universe has its proper place, hence one can deduce that objects fall to the ground because that’s where they belong, and smoke goes up because that’s where it belongs. The goal of Aristotelian science was to explain why things happen. Modern science was born when Galileo began trying to explain how things happen and thus originated the method of controlled experiment which now forms the basis of scientific investigation.

\21. The aim of controlled scientific experiments is ________.

[A] to explain why things happen

[B] to explain how things happen

[C] to describe self-evident principles（B）

[D] to support Aristotelian science

\22. What principles most influenced scientific thought for two thousand years?

[A] the speculations of Thales

[B] the forces of electricity, magnetism, and gravity

[C] Aristotle’s natural science（C）

[D] Galileo’s discoveries

\23. Bertrand Russell’s notion about electricity is ________.

[A] disapproved of by most modern scientists

[B] in agreement with Aristotle’s theory of self-evident principles

[C] in agreement with scientific investigation directed toward “how” things happen（C）

[D] in agreement with scientific investigation directed toward “why” things happen

\24. The passage says that until recently scientists disagreed with the idea ________.

[A] that there are mysterious forces in the universe

[B] that man cannot discover what forces “really” are

[C] that there are self-evident principles（B）

[D] that we can discover why things behave as they do

\25. Modern science came into being ________.

[A] when the method of controlled experiment was first introduced

[B] when Galileo succeeded in explaining how things happen

[C] when Aristotelian scientist tried to explain why things happen（A）

[D] when scientists were able to acquire an understanding of reality of reasoning

The manager was very polite, but he explained that someone with exactly the same name had presented them with a worthless Cheque not long ago.

Then the police asked my friend to copy out a note which had been used by the thief in a number of shops. The note : “I have a gun in my pocket. Ask no questions and give me all the money in the safe.” Fortunately, my friend’s handwriting was quite unlike the thief’s.

**Section VIII   English-Chinese Translation**

Translate the following passage into Chinese. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)

Have there always been cities? (71) Life without large urban areas may seem inconceivable to us, but actually cities are relatively recent development. Groups with primitive economics still manage without them. The trend, however, is for such groups to disappear, while cities are increasingly becoming the dominant mode of man’s social existence. (72) Historically, city life has always been among the elements which form a civilization. Any high degree of human endeavor and achievement has been closely linked to life in an urban environment. (73) It is virtually impossible to imagine that universities, hospitals, large businesses or even science and technology could have come into being without cities to support them. To most people, cities have traditionally been the areas where there was a concentration of culture as well as of opportunity. (74) In recent years, however, people have begun to become aware that cities are also areas where there is a concentration of problems. What has happened to the modern American city? Actually, the problem is not such a new one. Long before this century started, there had begun a trend toward the concentration of the poor of the American society into the cities. Each great wave of immigration from abroad and from the rural areas made the problem worse. During this century, there has also been the development of large suburban areas surrounding the cities, for the rich prefer to live in these areas. Within the cities, sections may be sharply divided into high and low rent districts, the “right side of town” and the slums.

Of course, everyone wants to do something about this unhappy situation. But there is no agreement as to goals. Neither is there any systematic approach or integrated program. Opinions are as diverse as the people who give them. (75) But one basic difference of opinion concerns the question of whether or not the city as such is to be preserved. Perhaps transportation and the means of communication have really made it possible for there to be an end to the big cities. Of course, there is the problem of persuading people to move out of them of their own free will. (76) And there is also the objection that the city has always been the core from which cultural advancement has radiated. Is this, however, still the case today in the presence of easy transportation and communication? Does culture arise as a result of people living together communally, or is it too the result of decisions made at the level of government and the communications industry?

It is probably true to say that most people prefer to preserve the cities. Some think that the cities could be cleaned up or totally rebuilt. This is easy to say; it would not be so easy to do. (77) To be sure, a great rebuilding project would give jobs to many of those people who need them. Living conditions could not help but improve, at least for a while. But would the problems return after the rebuilding was completed?

Nevertheless, with the majority of the people living in urban areas, the problem of the cities must be solved. (78) From agreement on this general goal, we have, unfortunately, in the past proceeded to disagreement on specific goals, and from there to total inaction. At the basis of much of this inaction is an old-fashioned concept -- the idea human conditions will naturally tend to regulate themselves for the general goal.

On Wednesday afternoons Annie took the bus into town to shop in the market. For an hour or  she would walk up and down between the stalls looking at everything, buying here and there, and  a sharp lookout for the bargains that were sometimes to be had. And then, with all the things she needed  she would leave the market for the streets of the town to spend another hour  she liked best: looking in furniture shop windows.

One Wednesday she found a new shop full of the most delightful things, with a notice inviting anyone to walk in and look  without feeling they had to buy something. Annie hesitated for a moment before stepping through the doorway where, almost at once, she stopped  before a green armchair. There was a card on the chair which said: “This fine chair is yours  less than a pound a week,” and very small at the bottom, “Cash price eighty-nine pounds fifty.” A pound a week... , she could almost pay that out of her housekeeping money and never miss it! A voice at her shoulder made her . “Can I help you, Madam?” She looked round at the assistant who had come softly to her .

“Oh, well, no,” she said. “I was just looking.” “We’ve chairs of all kinds in the showroom. If you’ll just come up, you will find something to suit you.”

**Text 1**

There are a great many careers in which the increasing emphasis is on specialization. You find these careers in engineering, in production, in statistical work, and in teaching. But there is an increasing demand for people who are able to take in great area at a glance, people who perhaps do not know too much about any one field. There is, in other words, a demand for people who are capable of seeing the forest rather than the trees, of making general judgments. We can call these people “generalists.” And these “generalists” are particularly needed for positions in administration, where it is their job to see that other people do the work, where they have to plan for other people, to organize other people’s work, to begin it and judge it.

The specialist understands one field; his concern is with technique and tools. He is a “trained” man; and his educational background is properly technical or professional. The generalist -- and especially the administrator -- deals with people; his concern is with leadership, with planning, and with direction giving. He is an “educated” man; and the humanities are his strongest foundation. Very rarely is a specialist capable of being an administrator. And very rarely is a good generalist also a good specialist in particular field. Any organization needs both kinds of people, though different organizations need them in different proportions. It is your task to find out, during your training period, into which of the two kinds of jobs you fit, and to plan your career accordingly.

Your first job may turn out to be the right job for you -- but this is pure accident. Certainly you should not change jobs constantly or people will become suspicious of your ability to hold any job. At the same time you must not look upon the first job as the final job; it is primarily a training job, an opportunity to understand yourself and your fitness for being an employee.

\26. There is an increasing demand for ________.

[A] all round people in their own fields

[B] people whose job is to organize other people’s work

[C] generalists whose educational background is either technical or professional（B）

[D] specialists whose chief concern is to provide administrative guidance to others

\27. The specialist is ________.

[A] a man whose job is to train other people

[B] a man who has been trained in more than one fields

[C] a man who can see the forest rather than the trees（D）

[D] a man whose concern is mainly with technical or professional matters

\28. The administrator is ________.

[A] a “trained” man who is more a specialist than a generalist

[B] a man who sees the trees as well as the forest

[C] a man who is very strong in the humanities（C）

[D] a man who is an “educated” specialist

\29. During your training period, it is important ________.

[A] to try to be a generalist

[B] to choose a profitable job

[C] to find an organization which fits you（D）

[D] to decide whether you are fit to be a specialist or a generalist

\30. A man’s first job ________.

[A] is never the right job for him

[B] should not be regarded as his final job

[C] should not be changed or people will become suspicious of his ability to hold any job（B）

[D] is primarily an opportunity to fit himself for his final job

**Text 2**

At the bottom of the world lies a mighty continent still wrapped in the Ice Age and, until recent times, unknown to man. It is a great land mass with mountain ranges whose extent and elevation are still uncertain. Much of the continent is a complete blank on our maps. Man has explored, on foot, less than one per cent of its area. Antarctica differs fundamentally from the Arctic regions. The Arctic is an ocean, covered with drifting packed ice and hemmed in by the land masses of Europe, Asia, and North America. The Antarctic is a continent almost as large as Europe and Australia combined, centered roughly on the South Pole and surrounded by the most unobstructed water areas of the world -- the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.

The continental ice sheet is more than two miles high in its centre, thus, the air over the Antarctic is far more refrigerated than it is over the Arctic regions. This cold air current from the land is so forceful that it makes the nearby seas the stormiest in the world and renders unlivable those regions whose counterparts at the opposite end of the globe are inhabited. Thus, more than a million persons live within 2,000  miles of the North Pole in an area that includes most of Alaska, Siberia, and Scandinavia -- a region rich in forest and mining industries. Apart from a handful of weather stations, within the same distance of the South Pole there is not a single tree, industry, or settlement.

\31. The best title for this selection would be ________.

[A] Iceland

[B] Land of Opportunity

[C] The Unknown Continent（C）

[D] Utopia at Last

\32. At the time this article was written, our knowledge of Antarctica was ________.

[A] very limited

[B] vast

[C] fairly rich（A）

[D] nonexistent

\33. Antarctica is bordered by the ________.

[A] Pacific Ocean

[B] Indian Ocean

[C] Atlantic Ocean（D）

[D] All three

\34. The Antarctic is made uninhabitable primarily by ________.

[A] cold air

[B] calm seas

[C] ice（A）

[D] lack of knowledge about the continent

\35. According to this article ________.

[A] 2,000 people live on the Antarctic Continent

[B] a million people live within 2,000 miles of the South Pole

[C] weather conditions within a 2,000 mile radius of the South Pole make settlements impractical（C）

[D] only a handful of natives inhabit Antarctica

**Section VIII   English-Chinese Translation**

Translate the following passage into Chinese. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)

It would be interesting to discover how many young people go to university without any clear idea of what they are going to do afterwards. (71) If one considers the enormous variety of courses offered, it is not hard to see how difficult it is for a student to select the course most suited to his interests and abilities. (72) If a student goes to university to acquire a broader perspective of life, to enlarge his ideas and to learn to think for himself, he will undoubtedly benefit. (73) Schools often have too restricting an atmosphere, with its time tables and disciplines, to allow him much time for independent assessment of the work he is asked to do. (74) Most students would, I believe, profit by a year of such exploration of different academic studies, especially those “all rounders” with no particular interest. They should have longer time to decide in what subject they want to take their degrees, so that in later life, they do not look back and say, “I should like to have been an archaeologist. If I hadn’t taken a degree in Modern Languages, I shouldn’t have ended up as an interpreter, but it’s too late now. I couldn’t go back and begin all over again.”

(75) There is, of course, another side to the question of how to make the best use of one’s time at university. (76) This is the case of the student who excels in a particular branch of learning. (77) He is immediately accepted by the University of his choice, and spends his three or four years becoming a specialist, emerging with a first-class Honour Degree and very little knowledge of what the rest of the world is all about. (78) It therefore becomes more and more important that, if students are not to waste their opportunities, there will have to be much more detailed information about courses and more advice. Only in this way can we be sure that we are not to have, on the one hand, a band of specialists ignorant of anything outside of their own subject, and on the other hand, an ever increasing number of graduates qualified in subjects for which there is little or no demand in the working world.

**(1)**

Television is now playing a very important part in our life. But television, like other things, has both advantages and disadvantages. Do the former outweigh the latter?

In the first place, television is not only a convenient source of entertainment, but also a comparatively cheap one. (66) For a family of four, for example, it is more convenient as well as cheaper to sit comfortably at home, with almost unlimited entertainment available, than to go out in search of amusement elsewhere. (67) They do not have to pay for expensive seats at the theatre, the cinema, or the opera, only to discover, perhaps, that the show is disappointing. (68) All they have to do is press a button, and they can see plays, films, operas, and shows of every kind, not to mention political discussions and the latest exciting football match. (69) Some people, however, maintain that this is precisely where the danger lies. The television viewer takes no initiative. He makes no choice and exercises no judgment. (70) He is completely passive and has everything presented to him without any effort on his part.

(71) Television, it is often said, keeps one informed about current events, allows one to follow the latest developments in science and politics, and offers and endless series of programs which are both instructive and entertaining. The most distant countries and the strangest custom are brought right into one's sitting-room. (72) It could be argued that the radio performs this service just as well; but on television everything is much more living, much more real. Yet here again there a danger. We get so used to looking at it, so dependent on its flickering pictures, that it begins to dominate our lives.

There are many other arguments for and against television. The poor quality of its programs is often criticized. But it is undoubtedly a great comfort to many lonely elderly people. And does it corrupt or instruct our children? I think we must realize that television in itself is neither good nor bad. (73) It is the uses to which it is put that determine its value to society.

An office is the "Brain" of a business. (74) In an office, figures, lists and information are compiled which tell the managers or heads of the business what is happening in their shops or factories. These figures guide the managers by telling them what has happened and what is happening.

Information comes into an office in all sorts of ways but the main items of information come in regularly. (75) It is part of the job of the clerks to collect and classify that information and to put it into such a form that it is easily interpreted and understood. Offices collect information then they classify it.

This work of collection is common in an office from the sorting of mail every morning to the accountant's work in finding out the final figure for the year's profit. (76) Classification always requires the arrangement of the same kind of information, often into lists or columns. (77) For this work, correctness, accuracy and speed, as in all office work, are essential.

There is no value, however, in collecting figures which mean nothing. Figures are guides which should help we make decisions. (78) The interpretation of information and of tables should tell us where success or failure lies, where profit can be had and where losses occur. (79) On this kind of information and from the known figures, a choice is made and a series of such choices may make a policy.

A firm which has three factories may find, for instance, from its figures, that one factory is losing money and a choice may lie between either a change of manager, a cut in production, an increase in production or closure of the factory. Whichever one of these decisions is taken becomes the policy. (80) It is clear that a decision leading to a policy can only be as good as the information on which it is based.

Consequently there is a constant search for more and more exact information. (81) Managers will want to have all the necessary facts before they can make the best decision and it is normal for them to seek for more and more information.

**Section VIII   English-Chinese Translation**

Choose either of the following two passages. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)

**(1)**

(81) Electricity is such a part of our everyday lives and so much taken for granted nowadays that we rarely think twice when we switch on the light or turn on the radio. At night, roads are brightly lit, enabling people and traffic to move freely. Neon lighting used in advertising has become part of the character of every modern city. In the home, many labour-saving devices are powered by electricity. (82) Even when we turn off the bedside lamp and are fat asleep, electricity is working for us, driving our refrigerators, heating our water, or keeping our rooms air-conditioned. Every day, trains, trolley-buses, and trams take us to and from work. (83) We rarely bother to consider why or how they run until something goes wrong.

One summer something did go wrong with the power plant that provides New York with electricity. For a great many hours, life came almost to a standstill. Trains refused to move and the people in them sat in the dark, powerless to do anything; (84) lifts stopped working, so that even if you were lucky enough not to be trapped between two floors, you had the unpleasant task of finding your way down hundreds of flights of stairs. Famous streets like Broadway and Fifth Avenue in an instant became as gloomy and uninviting as the most remote back streets. (85) People were afraid to leave their houses, for although the police had been ordered to stand by in case of emergency, they were just as confused and helpless as anybody else.

Meanwhile, similar disorder prevailed in the home. New York can be stifling in the summer and this year was no exception. Cool, air-conditioned apartments became furnaces. Food went bad in refrigerators. Cakes and joints of meat remained uncooked in cooling ovens. (86) People sat impatient and frightened in the dark as if an unseen enemy had landed from Mars. (87) One of the strange things that occurred during the power-cut was that some fifty blind people lead many sighted workers home. (88) When the lights came on again, hardly a person in the city can have turned on a switch without reflecting how great a servant he had at his fingertips.

A mineral is a material that is mined, not grown. (89) In other words mineral substances which are found on the earth must be extracted by digging, boring holes, artificial explosions, or similar operations which make them available to us. Some minerals, for example coal and oil, were originally living substances; others, like iron, never had life. (90) Coal and oil are the remains of plants and animals. Crude mineral ores and crude oil must be purified before they can be used.

(91) A stage in human civilization is often called by the name of the substance mainly used at that stage: the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and so on. The level of civilization reached by a society depends on the materials it can use, not only on those which are available. (92) The capacity to use a raw material depends on various factors, such as means of access, methods of extraction, and techniques of processing. In order to be purified, or combined into alloys, metals must be melted. For this purpose they must be placed in containers which can be heated to enormous temperatures. These containers or enclosed spaces are called furnaces. (93) Plants which refine crude ores are often located in countries other than those in which the crude ores are mined.

Although much was known previously about the chemical properties of aluminum and their application to practical uses, (94) it was not until sixty years ago that a method of extracting aluminum ore was found which could lead to a cheap large-scale process.

(95) In the past few decades men behaved as if their supplies of minerals were inexhaustible. (96) But now it is realized that supplies of some of them are limited, and it is even possible to give a reasonable estimate of their "expectation of life," the time it will take to exhaust all known sources and reserves of these materials.

But in the case of minerals it is especially difficult to give a reliable estimate of reserves because surveys have not been completed and it is not certain that all sources are known. Uranium provides a good example of this fact.

In the 20th century chemists have learned to make  of new compounds that never existed . Many of them are useful to industry. Industry also found new uses  old, well-known  such as mercury, arsenic, and lead. We have learned to use radioactive substances in manufacturing electrical power, and some materials used in medicine. Many of these substances are poisonous to people. Accidentally or  purpose, many of them are discharged into streams and lakes. Birds and fish are killed by them. In some   people have been killed or  by them. In some countries, many people were killed by eating fish that had lived in water contaminated with mercury;   others were crippled  life.

**Section VIII   English-Chinese Translation**

Choose either of the following two passages and translate it into Chinese. (25 points)

(1)

Let us suppose that you are in the position of a parent. Would you allow your children to read any book they wanted to without first checking its contents? Would you take your children to see any film without first finding out whether it is suitable for them? If your answer to these questions is ‘yes’, then you are just plain irresponsible. If your answer is ‘no’, then you are exercising your right as a parent to protect your children from what you consider to be undesirable influences. In other words, by acting as an examiner yourself, you are admitting that there is a strong case for censorship.

Now, of course, you will say that it is one thing to exercise censorship where children are concerned and quite another to do the same for adults. Children need protection and it is the parents’ responsibility to provide it. But what about adults? Aren’t they old enough to decide what is good for them? The answer is that many adults are, but don’t make the mistake of thinking that all adults are like yourself. Censorship is for the good of society as a whole. Like the law, it contributes to the common good.

Some people think that it is a shame that a censor should interfere with works of art. But we must bear in mind that the great proportion of books, plays and films which come before the censor are very far from being ‘works of art’.

When censorship laws are relaxed, dishonest people are given a chance to produce virtually anything in the name of ‘art’. One of the great things that censorship does is to prevent certain people from making fat profits by corrupting the minds of others. To argue in favour of absolute freedom is to argue in favour of anarchy. Society would really be the better if it were protected by correct censorship.

If the sun has enough power to warm and light the whole earth, it must have enough power to do other things, too. Can we use the sun’s abundant energy to supply electricity, or at least to perform the functions which electricity or other types of power usually perform? The answer is yes.

For example, people have for many years been using the reflected heat of the sun to cook by. Solar cookers have been built with several curved mirrors reflecting the sun and focusing its heat on the cooking element. This apparatus can be used just like a gas or electric stove; it is more expensive to make but it does not need any fuel, and so costs nothing to use. Another possibility of using solar energy is in house-heating.

The form of energy we use most is electricity, and every day more is needed. But electricity has to be made, too, and to make it huge quantities of fuel are required — oil, coal, gas and nowadays even uranium.

The question which worries everyone today is: how long will these fuels last? Nobody knows for sure, but most experts think it will soon be difficult to obtain sufficient electricity from these sources. It is possible that the sun can make a contribution here, too.

Solar power has already been used to produce terrific hat. In Southern France a solar furnace has been built, where temperatures reach more than 3000° Centigrade. This furnace is only used for experiments at present, but could be used to produce steam for a power station.

So it is possible that one day in the near future we will depend on solar furnaces and power stations to provide our electrical needs. Or perhaps each home will have a solar generator to provide power for lighting and heating.

让我们假设你处在家长的地位。你会允许你的孩子们随便读他们想读的书而不首先查一下内容吗？你会随便带你的孩子去看电影而不首先搞清楚这部片子对他们是否合适吗？假如你对这些问题的回答是“是”的话，那你简直就是不负责任。如果你回答“否”，那你就是在运用你家长的权利来保护你的孩子，使他们免受你认为不良的影响。换句话话，你在作为检查者时已经认定实行审查很有必要。

当然，你会说审查对儿童而言是一回事，但对成人却是另一回事。儿童需要保护，提供这种保护是父母的责任。但是成年人又如何呢？难道他们还不够成熟以判断哪些东西对他们有益吗？回答是许多成年人是能做到的。不过千万别误认为所有的成年人都象你自己一样。审查是为了整个社会的利益。它象法律一样维护公众利益。

有些人认为审查员干涉文艺作品是不光彩的事。可是我们要牢记送到审查员面前的大量书刊、戏剧和电影远非“杰作”。

当审查法放宽时，招摇撞骗之徒就会有机可乘在“艺术”的幌子下什么样的东西都会炮制出来。审查工作的大事之一就是防止某些人靠腐蚀别人的思想以谋取厚利。主张绝对自由就是主张无政府状态。如果社会得到正确审查制度的保护一定会变得更好。

太阳既然有足够的能量使整个地球变得温暖和明亮，它必定也有足够的能量做出其他的事。我们是否能利用太阳丰富的能源来发电，或至少是用它来做电力或别种动力通常要做的事？回答是肯定的。

例如，多年来人们一直在利用反射太阳光的热量来烧煮食物。太阳炉是用几面曲面镜反射阳光并将其热量聚焦于炊具上制成的。这种装置可以象煤气炉或电炉一样使用；制造成本虽然较高，但它不需用燃料，因而使用就不必花钱。太阳能的另一个可能性是取暖。

我们用得最多的能的形式是电。而且用量与日俱增。但是电也需要生产，要生产电就需要大量燃料，如石油、煤、可燃气，现在甚至用铀作燃料。

今天人人都担心的问题是：这些燃料能维持多久？谁也无法确知，但是大多数专家认为不需太久就难以靠这些来源提供充足的电力了。太阳倒有可能在这方面作出一定的贡献。

太阳能已被用来提供极高的温度。在法国南部已经建造了一座太阳炉，供热可高达摄氏3000度以上。这座太阳炉目前只用于实验工作，但是有可能给发电站提供蒸汽。

所以在不久的将来，我们有可能依靠太阳炉和太阳能发电站来提供我们对电力的需要。或许家家户户都将用太阳能来提供照明和加热用的电力。

Choose either of the following two passages and translate it into Chinese. (30 points)

(1)

In country after country, talk of non-smokers’ right is in the air. While a majority of countries have taken little or no action yet, some 30 nations have introduced legislative steps to control smoking. Many laws have been introduced in other countries to help clear the air for nonsmokers, or to cut cigarette consumption.

In some developed countries the consumption of cigarettes has become more or less stabilized. However, in many developing nations, cigarette smoking is seen as a sign of economic progress — and is even encouraged. As more tobacco companies go international, new markets are sought to gain new smokers in those countries. For example, great efforts are made by the American tobacco industry to sell cigarettes in the Middle East and North Africa — where U.S. tobacco exports increased by more than 27 percent in 1974.

Smoking is harmful to the health of people. World governments should conduct serious campaigns against it. Restrictions on cigarette advertisements, plus health warnings on packages and bans on public smoking in certain places such as theatres, cinemas and restaurants, are the most popular tools used by nations in support of nonsmokers or in curbing smoking. But world attention also is focusing on another step which will make the smoker increasingly self-conscious and uncomfortable about his habit. Great efforts should be made to inform young people especially of the dreadful consequences of taking up the habit. And cigarette price should be boosted.

In the long run, there is no doubt that everybody would be much better-off if smoking were banned altogether, but people are not ready for such drastic action.

Nuclear power’s danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be summed up in one word: radiation.

Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can’t be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can’t detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can’t sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things.

At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage many not be significant. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in a deformed way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.

This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak or liable to serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.

Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth.

不吸烟者的权利问题，正在一个又一个国家里开始议论。至今多数国家很少或还没有采取措施，有三十个左右的国家已经采取法律程序控制吸烟。另一些国家则已制订旨在为不吸烟者净化空气或消减纸烟消费量的多种法律。

在某些发达国家中。纸烟的消费量已渐趋稳定。然而在许多发展中国家里，吸烟却被视为经济发展的一种标志——甚至受到鼓励。随着更多的烟草公司走上国际化的道路，它们在这些国家中寻找新的市场，争取更多的吸烟者。例如美国烟草工业就力图在中东和北非推销香烟——在这些地区，美国烟草出口量在1974年增加了百分之二十七以上。

吸烟对人民健康有害。世界各国政府应该开展认真的反对吸烟运动。限制香烟广告，每包香烟上加印有害健康的警告，以及禁止在诸如影剧院和餐馆等某些公共场所吸烟，这些都是许多国家用以支持不吸烟者和控制吸烟最常用的办法。同时，人们也正把注意力集中在另一项措施上。这项措施将使吸烟者越来越意识到自己的不良习惯并为此感到不安。应该作出巨大努力告诉青年人抽烟的危害性，特别是养成抽烟习惯的可怕后果。而且香烟价格应予提高。

从长远观点看，毫无疑问，如果能完全禁止吸烟，那么每个人的境况将得到很大的改善。但对于采取这种极端措施，人们尚无准备。

核能对健康、安全甚至对生命本身构成的危险可以用一个词来概括：辐射。

核辐射这种现象多少有点神秘，其部分原因是人类的官能无法觉察到它的存在。尽管我们周围可能都是辐射线，可是我们看不风它，听不到它， 摸不着它，也辨别不出它的味道。还有一些和它相类似的东西。例如，我们四周到处都是无线电波，但如果没有无线电接收器，我们就不能探测到或感觉到它的存在。同样，如果不用辐射探测器，我们也不能感觉到放射现象。但核辐射不同于普通的无线电波，它对人类以及其他生物不是无害的。

能级非常高的辐射线能摧毁重要器官里的大量细胞从而把动物或人立即杀死。即使是最低能级的辐射线也能造成严重的损害。不存在任何绝对安全的辐射能级。如果辐射线没有击中任何重要的东西，造成的损害可能不太大。当辐射线只击中少数细胞并且立即摧毁它们的时候，情况就是这样。你的身体能以健康的细胞代替死亡的细胞。但如果这些少数的细胞只受到损坏，而这些细胞又自行繁殖，那你就会遇到麻烦。它们进行畸形繁殖。它们有可能演变成癌，这种情况有时在许多年之后才能显示出来。

这是核辐射现象带有某些神秘色彩的另一个原因。它可能在损害已经发生而受害者意识不到的情况下造成严重损害。一个人在受到照射时可能感觉良好，结果在五年、十年或二十年后死于癌症。或者小孩一生下来就体弱或易于感染严重的疾病，原因是他的祖父母曾吸收过辐射线。

辐射线能伤害我们。我们应该知道真相。

**Section VII English-Chinese Translation**

Choose one of the following three passages and translate it into Chinese. (40 points)

(1)

The United Kingdom is a monarchical (君主政体的) State. It is one of the independent members of the Commonwealth (the Queen is recognized as head of the Commonwealth), and a member of the European Community.

The origins and traditions of the United Kingdom are to be found in each of the four parts that make up the country: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. England was united as a kingdom a thousand years ago, and Wales became part of the kingdom during the middle ages. The thrones (王位) of England and Scotland were united in 1603, and in 1707 legislation passed in the two countries provided for the establishment of a single Parliament of Great Britain with supreme authority both in England and Wales and in Scotland. Ireland had had links with the kingdom of England since the thirteenth century, and in 1800 the creation of the United Kingdom was completed by a union joining the Irish Parliament to that of Great Britain. In 1922 Southern Ireland (now the Irish Republic) became a self-governing country. The six counties of Northern Ireland had in 1920 been given their own subordinate Parliament, and voted to remain within the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster in London — with an elected chamber comprising members from English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland constituencies (选举区) — therefore represents people sharing very varied backgrounds and traditions. It has ultimate authority for government and law-making, but administrative arrangements have developed in such a way as to take account of the particular needs of different areas.

England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other have different systems of law, different court systems, different education systems, different systems of local government and, for most domestic matters, different government departments.

As more people live closer together, and as they use machines to produce leisure, they find that their leisure, and even their working hours, become spoilt by a by-product of their machines — namely, noise. Noise is nowadays in the news; it has acquired political status, and public opinion is demanding, more and more insistently, that something must be done about it.

To control noise is to demand much self-discipline (annoyance arises often from lack of common courtesy), a sense of proportion (there is usually a conflict of interest if a noise is to be stopped), the expenditure of money (and it is far more economical to do this early rather that late), and finally, technical knowledge.

Technical difficulties often arise from the subjective-objective nature of the problem. You can define the excessive speed of a motor-car in terms of a pointer reading on a speedometer. But can you define excessive noise in the same way? You find that with any existing simple “noise-meter”, vehicles which are judged to be equally noisy may show considerable difference on the meter.

Though the ideal cure for noise is to stop it at its source, this may in many cases be impossible. The next remedy is to absorb it on its way to the ear.

Domestic noises may perhaps be controlled by forethought and courtesy, and industrial noises by good planning and technical improvement. But if we are going to allow fast motor-cycles and heavy diesel lorries to pass continuously trough residential and business districts, the community must decide on the control it needs to exercise, for in the long run it has got to pay for it. And if a nation is to take part in modern air transport, it must enter into international agreements on the noise control measures it will impose at its airports — and here the cost of any real control is to be measured in millions of dollars.

About 350 years ago Galileo made a telescope and looked through it at the sun. What he saw both surprised and frightened him, for he saw dark spots on the sun which at once suggested to him that God had not made the world quite as perfect as he had previously believed. He hesitated to make his discovery known. Meanwhile other scientists noticed the same lack of solar perfection and proclaimed (宣布) the fact.

But Galileo continued his observations and was soon rewarded with another discovery. Fixing his attention on a single sunspot (太阳黑子) group, he noticed that in a few days it had moved in position, just as if the sun itself were turning. Afterwards he found a sunspot group which lived long enough to disappear from view on the western limb (边缘) of the sun, to re-appear on its eastern limb, and finally to regain its old position. This led him to conclude that the sun itself was rotating and that the time it took to make one complete turn was about twenty-five to twenty-seven days. Actually we know from the drawings which Galileo made of sunspots that there must have been quite a lot of them at the time of his observations in the years 1611 and 1612. If he had gone on making his drawings in the years that immediately followed, we know that he would almost certainly have noticed that sunspots were becoming fewer and smaller. But he became interested in other things and so he failed to recognize that there is a kind of long-term cycle in sunspot activity, the sunspots increasing and decreasing as the years go on. Later this discovery of the sunspot activity was made by one of the most patient observers in the history of science, a German chemist, Charles Schwabe.

联合王国是一个君主政体的国家。它是英联邦内独立的国家之一（女王被承认是英联邦的首脑），也是欧洲共同体的成员国。

联合王国的起源和传统可从组成它的四个部分——英格兰、威尔士、苏格兰和北爱尔兰——的各个部分找到。英格兰在一千年前统一为一个王国，威尔士则于中世纪时成为这王国的一个组成部分。一六〇三年，英格兰与苏格兰的王位合而为一；一七〇七年两国通过立法，规定设立一个单一的、在英格兰和威尔士以及在苏格兰均享有最高权力的大不列颠国会。爱尔兰与英格兰王国自十三世纪起已有联系；一八〇〇年由于爱尔兰国会并入大不列颠国会，联合王国的创建便告完成。一九二二年，南爱尔兰（现在的爱尔兰共和国）成为一个自主的国家。北爱尔兰的六个郡已于一九二〇年被授权成立自己的、在联合王国国会之下的议会，并投票表决留在联合王国内。

在伦敦威斯敏斯特的联合王国国会——它有一个选举出来的、由英格兰、苏格兰、威尔士和北爱尔兰各地选区所产生的议员组成的议院——因此代表具有十分不同的背景和传统的人民。它具有最高的政府权力和立法权，但在行政管理方面已作出了安排以照顾不同地区的特殊需要。

英格兰和威尔士以及苏格兰两者各有不同的法律制度，不同的法院系统，不同的教育制度，不同的地方政府制度，并且设有不同的政府部门来处理大部分的内部事务。

随着更多的人住得更近，随着他们使用各种机器而获得闲暇，他们发现他们的空暇，甚至他们的工作时间都受到他们机器的一个副产品——即噪音——的严重影响。现在新闻报导中经常谈论噪音；它已取得了政治地位，公众舆论也越来越坚持要求采取一定措施来对付噪音。

要控制噪音就得要求很大程度的自我约束（使人烦恼的事常常是由于缺乏普通的礼貌引起的），一种均衡感（如果要制止噪音，通常会引起利害冲突），化钱（早化钱比晚化钱经济得多），最后还有技术知识。

技术往往是由于问题的主客观性质引起的。你可以根据速度计上指针所指的读数来确定一辆汽车的超速。可是，你能用同样的方法来确定超量的噪音吗？你会发现，被认为噪音相同的车辆，在任何现有的简单“噪音计”上显示的读数可能大不相同。

虽然消除噪音的最理想方法是产生的根源处消灭它，但在很多情况下，这也许是不可能的。其次的补救办法是将混音在它到达耳朵的过程中吸收掉。

家里的噪音或许可能通过事先的考虑与谦让加以控制，工业噪音则可能通过良好的规划与技术的改进加以控制。但是，如果我们允许高速摩托车与重型内燃机卡车经常不断地通过住宅区与商业区，那么这些地区的全体居民就必须决定他们需要实行的控制措施，因为从长远的观点来看，他们必须为些付出代价。如果一个国家要有现代化的空中运输，它必须参加国际噪音控制措施协定，这些措施它必须责成它的机场予以执行——而在这个问题上，任何真正控制措施的费用要以百万美元来计算。

大约在三百五十年前，伽利略制造了台望远镜，并用它来观察太阳。他所看到的景象使他感到既吃惊又害怕，因为他看到太阳上有一些黑点，这使他立刻联想到上帝创造的世界并不象他以前所相信的那么完美。他犹豫不决，不敢把他的发现公布于世。与此同时，其他的科学家也注意到太阳的这个缺陷，并宣布了这个事实。

但是，伽利略继续进行观测，不久，他的努力获得了另一发现。他把注意力集中在一群太阳黑子上，他发现，在几天内，这群黑子的位置起了变化，宛如太阳本身在转动。后来，他发现有一群黑子在太阳西部的边缘上停留了一段时间才消失，然后在太阳的东部边缘上最后回复原位。此种现象导致他得出这样的结论：太阳本身在旋转，旋转一周约需二十五到二十七天。直，我们从伽利略所画的太阳黑子图中知道，在一六一一和一六一二年他观察太阳期间，一定曾出现过大量的太阳黑子。如果在随后的几年中，他继续把这些太阳黑子描画下来，我们相信，他大概一定会发现太阳黑子正在变得愈来愈少和愈来愈小。可是，那时候，他却对其他事物发生的兴趣，因此，他看不到在太阳黑子的活动中存在着一种长期的周期，随着岁月的消逝，太阳黑子会时多时少。后来，发现太阳黑子活动周期的是人是科学史上最有耐心的观察者之一——德国化学家查尔斯·许伟勃。

The life of Albert Einstein is a model in many ways for both natural and political scientists.

First of all, he always employed the scientific method of seeking truth from facts. He firmly believed as he put it, that “there is nothing incomprehensible about the universe,” and through painstaking work, explained many of the phenomena thought to be “incomprehensible” in his day. Einstein was also never afraid to admit mistakes when facts proved his theories wrong.

Second, Einstein’s contributions showed the great importance of theoretical work to scientific effort. Although he himself rarely worked in laboratories, the concepts he developed led to many of the scientific advances which have shaped modern technology.

Third, Einstein believed very deeply that scientists must have a moral and social consciousness. In this way, he provided inspiration for a whole generation of scientists who became active in the Communist movement.

Einstein is often portrayed in bourgeois writings as a “genius” whose theories are so complicated that no one but a few best scientists can understand them. But he himself rejected the efforts to put him in a position far above other people. He was well known for his humble manner and often stressed to interviewers that his accomplishments would certainly have been achieved by others had he never lived.

Actually, Einstein’s theory of relativity and his other scientific works are not that hard to understand with a little study. But beyond learning Einstein’s theories, his overall attitude towards science as a tool to liberate humanity is something from which everyone can and should learn.

Between now and the end of the century, there will be many exciting developments and also many difficult problems to deal with. Perhaps the most urgent problem is to provide enough food. The world’s population is expected to reach 7,000 million by the year 2000, but already scientists have produced new and better varieties of wheat and rice and animal. They have also been experimenting with techniques of cultivating plants by using mixtures of chemical compounds and water only, and then there will be no need for ordinary soil. Another problem which the world will face is to get rid of refuse (废料). One solution is to burn refuse at very high temperatures in incinerators (焚化炉). A development of this, which may prove very useful in the future, is to use these incinerators to generate steam power. In fact, any new source of energy will be very welcome, as there is already a shortage of petroleum. To solve the energy problem, scientists will probably also try to make more use of solar energy.

The possible effects of some scientific fields, such as lasers and cryogenics (低温学), are difficult to imagine and both already have a number of uses. The supercooling effects of the cryogenics which convert liquid helium (液态氦) and other gases into “superfluids” and metals into “superconductors”, making them non-resistant to electricity, could change the world in a number of ways. The laser, with its beam of strong light, can drill a hole in a diamond, and yet can be so well controlled that it can be used in delicate eye operations. The question is whether it will be most used for peaceful purposes or as a deadly weapon.

But perhaps the most remarkable developments will occur in space flight. One of the difficulties in the past has been the high cost, but now the space shuttle is being developed, and can be used a large number of times instead of only once. Already man has been to the moon. Perhaps by the end of the century he will have had a close-up view of Venus (金星) or Mars (火星).

阿伯特·爱因斯坦的一生在许多方面，无论是对自然科学家，还是政治科学家，都是一个范例。

首先，他总是运用从事实中寻求真理的地。正如他所说的，他坚信“关于宇宙没有东西是不可知的，”并经过艰苦的劳动，了许多在他那个时代被认为是“不可知”的种种现象。而且，当事实证明他的理论是错误的时候，爱因斯坦也从不害怕承认错误。

其次，爱因斯坦的贡献说明理论工作对科学成就的巨大的重要性。虽然他自己很少在实验室工作，他所发展的各种概念使科学取得了许多进展，从而形成了现代技术。

第三，爱因斯坦深信科学家必须具有道德和社会意识。这样，他鼓舞了整个一代的科学家，使他们积极参加共产主义运动。

爱因斯坦在资产阶级的笔下被描绘为一个“天才”，他的理论是如此地难于理解，以致只有少数最杰出的科学家才能懂得。但是，他本人不同意别人把他高置于他人之上的那些做法。他的谦逊态度是众所周知的，他常常对来访者强调说，如果没有他的话，别人也肯定能够取得他那样的成就。

事实上，爱因斯坦的相对论以及他的其他科学论著稍加研究是不难懂得的。但是除了学习爱因斯坦的理论外，他对于利用科学作为一种工具来解放人类的总的态度是每个人能够学习的，而且也是应该学习的。

从现在到本世纪末，将有许多令人兴奋的发展，同样也有许多困难的问题，需要加以处理。也许最为迫切的问题是提供足够的粮食。到2000年世界人口预期将达到70亿，但是科学家们已经培育出各种小麦、稻谷和牲畜的优良品种。他们还在实验只用化合物和水的混合剂来培植作物的技术，到那里就可不需一般的土壤了。世界将面对着的另一问题是处理废物。有一个解决办法就是在焚化炉中用高温的废物烧掉。这种方法的一个新发展，可能在将来证明极为有用，即是以这些焚火炉来产生蒸汽动力。事实是，任何新的能源都将是非常受欢迎的，因为石油已感不足。要解决能源问题，科学家们也许会高潮更多地利用太阳能。

诸如激光学和低温学，某些科学领域的可能作用是难以想象的，它们两者已经有若干用途。低温学的过冷作用将液态氦及某些气体变成“超流体”，将某些金属变成“超导体”，使它们没有电阻，从而可以在好些方面改变世界面貌。激光，以它强烈的光束，可在金刚石上钻孔，也可以很好地加以控制来进行难做的眼科手术。问题是它将被大量用于和平的目的呢，还是用途致使的武器。

但最惊人的发展也许将出现在宇宙飞行方面。过去的困难之一在于代价太高。但现在航天飞机正在发展，这种航天飞机可以使用多次而不是仅仅一次而已。人类已经到过月球。也许到本世纪末人类对金星或火星等将有一个精细的观察。
